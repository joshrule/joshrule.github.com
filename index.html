<h4>Way of the Scholar</h4>

<p>In late 2010, I started writing Way of the Scholar to record what I've learned
about expertise, particularly in the hard sciences.  My goal is to make it a
scientific guide to scientific expertise. That is, I want to use scientific
tools to understand how people can sustainably advance the state of the art and
share those advances with the world in a way that makes it a dramatically
better place.</p>

<p>I've since realized that a blog really isn't the right medium for this sort of
work. I want something that emphasizes systematic logical structures, not
accidental chronological ones. So, I've stopped writing Way of the Scholar as a
blog and begun rewriting it as a book. The original posts are here for your
benefit, and if You find them helpful, please <a href="http://twitter.com/joshrule" title="Twitter">let me know</a>.</p>
