Today is day 26 of my 30-day trial to use at least 15 minutes, usually 30, of
my time in the lab reflecting on my research.

Someone asked me this week, "What do you actually do for that half-hour each
day? You haven't really told us yet. Take me through it minute-by-minute."
And, she was right. I've written several thousand words about this trial, but
I haven't given you a clear idea of what I'm actually doing. I've just hand-
wavingly claimed the awesomeness of thinking. Today, you'll find out what I've
really been doing for the past 5 weeks.

#### But, What Do You Actually Do?

I start by pulling out a notebook and pen. [Writing things down][2] helps me
think more clearly and remember my thoughts longer. Then, I ask myself some
sort of question about my research. That question could be anything from, "Why
am I even interested in neuroscience?" to, "How does my research solve
problems and help people?" Increasingly, though, I've been asking myself two
things each day:

*  What do today's results mean? (Where am I?)
*  What data do I need next? (Where do I want to go tomorrow?)

If you read [the past reports][3] for this trial, you'll see that these
questions weren't initially obvious. I asked very different questions for the
first few weeks, if I asked myself anything at all. But, I'm more confident
each day that these are the right questions to be asking. This past week has
been one of the most productive I've had at the lab since starting here. I
attribute most of that productivity to this trial and, more specifically, to
these questions.

#### Thinking Time Feedback Loop

The first question, _what do today's results mean_, forces me to understand
what I've actually accomplished during the day. I spend time interpreting my
work in terms of its actual significance to my research goals. I don't get to
point to a list full of crossed-off tasks and congratulate myself on my
productivity. It's not about getting things done. It's about [explaining the
universe][4]. Also, note that this question presupposes I have new results
each day. Framing it this way keeps me working in small chunks. It protects me
from investing a month in an idea without any indication that the results will
be even vaguely helpful.

If the first question shows me where I am now, the second, _what data do I
need next_, helps me decide where I want to go. This question is where new
hypotheses are formed and new simulations get outlined. I think a lot about
the end goal of my research during this question. I compare where I am to
where I want to be, and thumbnail several possible theories that, if I changed
my simulations accordingly, might close the gap. Unless there's a clearly
correct answer to this question, I try to flesh out as many ideas as possible.
I don't often know what will actually be the most helpful thing to do, because
I'm still very new to this type of science and research. But, by the time I've
examined all the most obvious options, one typically stands out as the best
for tomorrow's work. If not, I have the chance to shoot my PI an email before
I leave. A good idea is invariably in my inbox by the time I get back to the
lab the next morning.

Together, these two questions form a feedback loop that, applied daily,
provides clear and regular feedback about my performance as a scientist. It
helps me make a long series of tiny adjustments that constantly edge me closer
to a significant result and better science.

#### Then, I Think Some More

Answering those two questions takes 20 minutes on average. It would take much
longer if I did it weekly or monthly, and it would be much less precise. I'd
be doing more and remembering less. The regularity makes it easy to understand
how each bit of progress ties to those which came before it.

For the last 10 minutes or so, I tend to think more broadly about the
following questions:

*  How was my attitude toward my work?
*  How was my attitude toward people?
*  How was my physical energy and mental clarity today?
*  How was my general focus and productivity?
*  What can I do to improve all these things?

I don't cover all these questions every day, and I rarely answer any one of
them in great detail. Instead, they serve as a sort of mental checklist that
helps me find easy fixes to make me more useful in the lab. I've made several
simple changes because of these questions that have dramatically improved my
happiness and focus in the lab. For example, I started carrying bigger lunches
(peanut-butter and banana sandwich, anyone?) and added a snack mid-morning. I
even started being more careful not to oversleep, because I noticed that too
much sleep leaves me obnoxiously lethargic.

#### And, Why in the World Would You Do That?

In addition to these tight feedback loops, I've recently noticed several other
benefits to setting aside some thinking time:

space to close the day
: When I leave the lab, I've thought about the meaning of my day's work, the
interactions I had with people, and my corresponding attitudes. I've taken a
few minutes to shoot off any appropriate emails, and written an outline for
the next day's work. My thinking time provides a great buffer between lab and
home.

better focus each day
: Coming in with a direction and knowing that I'll have to physically write
about the significance of my actions provides extra motivation to head in a
helpful direction[^1]. And, every day I maintain this high focus, the easier
it becomes and the more motivated I am to maintain it.

deeper understanding of my research questions
: Having space to think about your work makes things clear that would otherwise
be lost in the hustle and bustle of making things happen. I actually uncovered
a conceptual flaw in my simulations last week that explains why my results
continue to be slightly off. This week, I'll get the chance to fix that
problem, which might otherwise have taken several more weeks to uncover.

habitually stopping and thinking
: I'm used to seeing solutions to problems immediately. Running up against a
wall, especially the wall of the relatively unknown is taking some
adjustment[^2]. The new demand for thoughtfulness is also helping me to read
papers with more understanding and driving me to write better code. Deep
involvement with a problem makes learning more relevant.
  
#### This Trial Is Powerful

I won't claim that these questions will be the right ones for everyone. But,
they've been incredibly helpful to me. And, even if these particular questions
aren't perfectly suited to you, the process of regular feedback and
incremental improvement is. I encourage you to adopt this trial in some form.
A few minutes each day can bring incredible clarity to your work and more than
pay for itself in just a few weeks.

Thursday, I'll look at the scientific method. Once good biases are in place,
it is perhaps the key tool required for great science. And next Monday, I'll
post the final report for this trial. Specifically, I'll share the fundamental
reason great science _requires_ reflection.


[^1]: Setting my direction the night before is more helpful than taking time to do it each morning. Because I've told my brain it's an important problem, I often have an idea or two over the course of the evening, and I get my entire commute to hype myself up for the day's work, because I know exactly what it will be.
[^2]: I say _relatively_, because I'm not doing something totally unimaginable. I'm just pushing the current theories a bit further.
