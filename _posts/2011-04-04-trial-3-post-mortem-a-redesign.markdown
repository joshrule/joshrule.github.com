Over the past month, I've written more than 2 dozen concise explanations of
ideas my research areas hinge on, the [keystone ideas][2]. It's been a useful
exercise and the deeper understanding I've gained gives me an even better
handle on the work I'm doing, why it's important, and how it helps both my
field and the general public.

But, my first attempt at a project is rarely the best or the last I'll do, and
the same is true for this trial. These last 30 days were a nice first attempt,
but I can do a better job of making these explanations useful to me and by
extension, to you and the rest of the world. Today, I'd like to tear down this
trial and rebuild an even better habit of writing micro-explanations to help
you do great science.

#### Understanding Comes First

One of the key things this trial got right was its encouragement to stop and
understand ideas instead of moving quickly and without comprehension. I'm
learning not just through this trial, but also through simple human-to-human
interaction that communication will be vital to doing great science, and
probably to doing great _anything_[^1]. Reading is a form of asynchronous
communication. Somebody took the time to put their ideas in writing, and if
you won't take the time to understand what they're trying to say, why bother
reading at all? We've got to understand what's already being said if we hope
to make any new contributions.

When a conversation gets confusing or frustrating, I often repeat what I've
heard back to someone in my own words. It's one of the most effective ways I
know to make sense out of verbal confusion. This trial does the same thing.
Conversations at the edge of knowledge can be difficult, especially when you
are trying to make your first contribution or two. Summarize what people say
in your own words to ensure you understand their work. Only then can you use
those ideas to build something new and helpful.

#### And With It, Experience

A second major strength of this trial is that it artificially builds
experience.That is, by forcing yourself to deliberately practice a skill you
need as a scientist - forming new explanations - you get better at developing
explanations. Where I initially fumbled for the sorts of things worth
including in an explanation, I increasingly know which sorts of ideas are most
worth exploring. I'm by no means an expert yet. But, I'm improving.

And, that's the goal with this trial - that we become remarkably good at
explaining things which have already been explained. That way, we develop an
explicit knowledge of the important types of things to explore when developing
_new_ explanations. When I start trying to write up an explanation for some
new problem, I want to start with a good idea of what the end product should
look like, structurally. Solving a small, known problem helps you learn the
patterns needed to solve larger, unknown problems.

One requirement for this sort of deliberate practice, though, is that it have
a good feedback mechanism. Without one, it's impossible to gauge how well you
are performing, impossible to tell if you're improving. Unfortunately, I
didn't focus much on this need when designing the trial.

The solution may be as simple as posting your work to [Quora][3] or [Hacker
News][4] and asking for comments, but it may be an even better idea to check
your understanding against a principal investigator, post-doc, or experienced
grad student. The one-on-one feedback would make these explanations even more
effective, because it would ensure your practice was heading in the right
direction, toward the work of a master scientist. Either way, ask in [the same
place regularly][5], because you may as well not measure if you use an
inconsistent ruler.

#### An Arbitrary But Inviolable Limit

For the ideas this trial targets, 100 words still seems like the right length.
You're not explaining the entire universe in one go, and you're also not
explaining the difference between 1+1 and 2. You're explaining ideas just
beyond reach.

Writing fewer than 100 words probably means you've picked too small an idea or
not explained it well enough. If you consistently pick ideas too similar to
what you already know, remember that these explanations are not a thesaurus.
You putting together a nice set of relatively independent tools, so that when
you find another new idea, it becomes even easier to understand and explain.
If you pick good ideas but average only 50-word explanations, make sure you've
captured all the important concepts. An explanation is more than just a
definition. It cares about the motivations and consequences of an idea, too,
and the way it connects to other major concepts.

If you find yourself consistently writing well over 100 words, perhaps you've
picked too big an idea. Pick small, interesting ideas that give you a better
grip on your research and related work. You may also be trying to explain too
much of an idea. Capture only the novel conceptual bits, not a complete
bibliography or detailed implementation. If you've gotten both the right idea
size and the right things to say about it, you may still be saying them
poorly. Make words earn their place in your explanations and ruthlessly cull
sloppy sentences. With practice, you'll learn to write tight, conceptually
dense prose.

Whatever you do, don't simply write down someone else's explanation. Make it
your own. Build understanding, not a list of things you only half-know.

#### Explaining Gauges Reading

Perhaps my biggest frustration with this trial was running out of new ideas to
explain. I've gotten a bit lax about setting aside time each day to encounter
new ideas, which was the main thrust of my [first trial][6]. Consequently, the
buffer of relevant concepts to dig into emptied out several times this month,
and I had to scrounge around, generally for things I already understood
decently well or which were interesting, but not difficult to summarize.

My first reaction to observing an empty list of things to explain was to
conclude that perhaps this trial wasn't best done daily. Perhaps it was better
to write up these explanations only as needed, rather than simply forcing
myself to write without challenge or stimulation for days on end.

That idea is right, but the conclusion is wrong. This trial works best with
new, challenging ideas. But, an empty buffer in this case wasn't a sign that I
was writing too often. It was a sign I hadn't been working hard enough to
expose myself to new things. As scientists, we should be spending the bulk of
our time on our current research, giving our days to solving one or two
problems at a time. But, we should regularly devote time to learning about new
things in our field and related fields that may help our research. A few hours
a week can make a big difference.

The list of concepts to explain with this third trial serves as a nice
barometer of how well your broad learning time is spent. If there are few
ideas, you're not reading enough, or you're reading the wrong things. If the
list is a mile long, you're probably not spending enough time on your primary
research. But, if you've listed a few interesting ideas to explore, you've
nailed it[^2].

The practice of building a new explanation daily is a good one and rather than
being relaxed, should be more strictly enforced. It indicates how well we are
managing our active exploration of tangentially-related research.

#### 100-Word Explanations, Take 2

Again, the first iteration of this trial has been helpful to me. But, to make
it better, I'd recommend the following redesign.

*  Explain ideas primarily from broad, exploratory reading. You should be arming yourself with new tools, not struggling to keep up with developments in your field.
*  Write 95 to 100 words nearly every time. The hard limit will help you find properly-sized ideas.
*  Write a new explanation every day you work, _without_ exception. Use the length of your list of words to gauge how well you're finding new ideas.
*  Be ruthless about writing your own explanation. Gloss over ideas you know well and focus on the new connections. Write down what you'd say to explain the idea to a friend.
*  Review your explanations with someone who understands the field better than you do, and use the same someone consistently. Improving requires a standard to measure against. 

I'm sure this particular set of rules isn't perfect, either, and if I see
major flaws worth noting, I'll post them here. But, these rules will help you
develop the habit of explaining, one of the most important a new scientist can
adopt. Science is an attempt to explain the world around us, and if you aren't
willing to do it, this may not be the field for you.


[^1]: Unless, of course, you want to be great at not communicating or something which entails not communicating. Unless you have a strong reason to be good at non-communication, I'd suggest aiming your great performance elsewhere.
[^2]: If new ideas come up in the supporting literature you read directly for your research, explain those too. But hopefully, you know your field well enough that the bulk of your new ideas come from exploratory reading.
