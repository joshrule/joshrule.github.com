Today is day 8 of my current 30-day trial. I'm reading neuroscience research
for at least an hour each day for 30 days. If you haven't read the
[introductory post][2] yet, you might find it helpful before reading the rest
of this post.

I'll kick things off with a few observations from this first week. Then, I
want to focus on something I've learned about my reading choices: namely, not
all reading is equally helpful.

#### So Far

The last seven days have gone well. I've completed my reading each day, and
I've read a variety of different things. I've finished about 20% of a standard
[introduction to Neuroscience][3], and I've polished off several papers on
widely-varying topics in neuroscience. So, using the strict definition of the
trial, it's going very well.

But, I've noticed a few things that influence how fruitful my reading will be
each day.

*  I'm finding that the earlier I start my reading, the more focused I am. An hour of quiet attention before interacting with anyone is much easier to complete than an hour sometime in the middle of the day or evening. Also, I'm a bit energetic, so I focus better after I've slightly tired myself out. My two mile bike ride to work has been perfect, but a few pushups work well if I catch the bus instead.

*  I'm also increasingly interested in the inner workings of individual neurons and their basic chemical interactions. That's as far as I've gotten in my textbook, and I wonder if I'll be just as excited when I reach the chapters about behavior and cognition. That is, I'm wondering if my interest is due to the material or the textbook's style. Whatever the case, it's great to be excited about what I'm learning.

*  But, more mathematics would be really useful. I've come across concepts from signal processing and non-linear dynamics that make me wish I knew more than just the name of the field. And, almost every paper I read reminds me that I've only taken one course on statistics and probability. So, I may use a future trial to build some regular math education into my day. Math is a language like English or Malay; the more we read it, write it, and think it, the easier it is to understand what's written in it. In fact, Paul Graham has talked [several][4] [times][5] about how math is one of our richest sources for metaphor, and Richard Hamming talks about the density and expressiveness of math early in [his book][6] on style in science and engineering (You can find the quote in the free chapter after the link).

*  I've probably spent less time this week browsing the web or shooting off emails than in the 2-3 weeks prior. But, I think that might have more to do with time restrictions I've activated at [one of my favorite sites][7] than with the new reading habit. In fact, I think I am more likely to distract myself on the web just before and after my reading than during any other part of the day. After a long period of focus, I want to distract myself for a while. I've installed [a small app][8] to grab more concrete data about my time use, which I'll share in future updates.

*  My readings have been a great case of [thinking like a thief][9], which we discussed last time. If I had to rediscover all this neuroscience myself, I'd be stuck in the Dark Ages. Fortunately, though, decades of solid research have been condensed into just a few hundred pages, leaving me free to dive into the unknown rather than the once-known but unshared and now forgotten[^1].

#### What to Read?

While the above are all moderately helpful, the key finding this week is the
following: **not all information is equally relevant all the time.** That's
probably an obvious statement to you, but it's become blindingly clear to me
this week.

Because I don't own the textbook I'm reading right now, I left it at the lab
over the weekend and read some papers I'd downloaded instead. I quickly found
myself wishing that I'd just lugged the book home with me. The writing style
is clearer, and the material is much easier to follow. It doesn't assume deep
knowledge of brain function or any advanced background from chemistry or
physics. It's simply painting a broad picture of the major research in
neuroscience.

It's not that the papers aren't good, it's more that they're not really what I
need right now. I need an orientation to the field of neuroscience as a whole,
limiting detailed reading to my specific projects. Reading papers from several
branches of neuroscience simultaneously is actually more disorienting than
orienting. Without any background in a particular line of research, I quickly
get lost and find myself stumbling to the end of the paper with little
comprehension, much less insight.

This trial tests whether reading quickly builds basic understanding in a given
field. But, because it's running for a limited time, the choice of reading
material is important. Reading anything and everything won't get me anywhere.
The reading has to be consciously directed to the most suitable books and
papers for where I am right now. I've got to pay attention only to the right
research.

So, from this week's experience I'd encourage you, if you're new to your
field, to find one of its standard introductory textbooks and read through it.
Don't just pick and choose a few chapters. Actually read the book. If it's any
good, it will help you organize many of the area's sub-disciplines and
highlight the history of their major developments. Both are helpful for
understanding where you are now and how you can begin to do good work. If
you've already built up a reasonable background, you're probably past this
step. But if, like me, you're just getting started in a brand-new field, read
a textbook, not just a smattering of current research.

The textbook provides a sense of place and is a bit like stopping into the
local visitor's center. You can get an idea of the character and history of
the town and pick up a map or two. Individual papers, though, are like local
pubs in small villages. Without a little history in the area, you'll be hard
pressed to get much value from it.

As my background develops, I expect that specific papers will become more
relevant to my particular questions and research. Then, I'll start paying
closer attention to those particular papers, while ignoring almost everything
else getting published. Until then, I'll keep reading my book. We've got to be
vigilant at all times to make sure the information we spend our time with is
the best for our current situation. As [Cal Newport says][10] (following
Winifred Galligher), we've got to cultivate our minds like a private garden,
being careful with what we let in and what sorts of tools we use.

#### Remember This

I've talked about a number of different things today, but the key one to
remember is that not all information is equally relevant all the time.
Sometimes, we need the orientation and breadth of an introductory textbook.
Sometimes, we need the narrow focus and depth of the latest research papers.
Treating these like they are identical is a serious mistake and sets us up for
frustration.
