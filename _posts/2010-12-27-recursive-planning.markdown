As the new year looms large on the horizon, you are probably making plans for
the next 365 days, and may even be considering a resolution or two. But, plans
and resolutions are notoriously prone to failure. Today, I want to expose some
of the major problems with detailed planning, especially in science. I'll then
propose an alternative to traditional planning which avoids many of those
problems.

#### Problems with Planning

The first major problem with planning is that humans simply aren't very good
at it. We [overestimate][2] what we can do in a day, underestimate what we can
do in a year, and usually don't even consider more than [1 or 2 steps][3]
beyond the present. Our ability to plan is embarrassingly limited when
compared with the relevant dynamics of an entire planet. Although we have the
capacity to plan and consider the future in abstract, we aren't that good at
it, and we get worse the further we look. How well did the science fiction of
the 1950s predict the world we live in today? Well, let's just say I'm still
waiting for my flying car, inter-galactic starship, and perfect artificial
intelligence.

Plans are static. We use as much information as is available when we write the
plan, but we can't use information that will be newly available when we
actually execute the plan. That's okay except for one thing: the world is a
dynamic place. A great deal will change between the writing of a plan and its
execution. New information, and entirely new techniques, may be available at
the time of execution, leaving weeks and months of planning wasted.

And, even the best plans aren't really that good. Developing a plan uses many
resources, particularly time. And, because they require so much early
investment, they're often rigid and limited in scope. Even the best plans have
trouble adapting to new information without a complete rewrite. Plans also
require detailed and nearly complete knowledge of the problem they're solving.
The more unknowns a plans faces, the less confident we can be in its
usefulness. Because of all these shortcomings, plans are brittle, and can fail
at any second.

Just ask the great military leaders of history. Confident that they knew their
opponent, many a smug general and his faithful army marched right into an
[ambush][4]. Their entire battle plan crumbled in an instant as they realized
their failure to account for some critical detail about their enemy.

As scientists, who essentially stare into the unknown for a living,
traditional planning is a dangerous habit.

#### Decisions in the Moment

The fact that detailed, full-blown plans aren't well-suited for science
doesn't mean we are left working blindly. Instead, we have an even better tool
at our disposal: recursive planning.

Instead of trying to work out the entire plan all at once, I'm proposing that
we plan this way: do a fantastic job working out the current decision, and let
the future-you put together the rest of the plan later. Because your future
self will be more experienced and have better information on the actual
decisions you'll make, trust it to actually make better decisions. That way,
you can focus on making the best possible decision now. In math, functions
built this way are called _[recursive][5]_, hence recursive planning.

Instead of spending days and weeks crafting plans in ignorance, we should
spend that time exploring _all_ our options for only the current decision and
finding the most helpful information for making that decision and tracking its
success. We often don't know what we don't know about the future or what will
be important to us in just a few weeks time. But, in the context-rich now, we
typically have a decent idea of what facts might help us make a better
decision about doing [the most important thing][6]. And, that decent idea can
usually be turned into a well-justified decision with just a little bit more
thinking, testing, and information gathering. Instead of building plans 16 or
20 decisions deep, we should focus on making the best decision we can right
now.

#### Benefits For Your Science

It's an interesting idea, but why should a scientist rely heavily on good
information at decision time instead of good planning? Well, even the best
planning is inherently unscientific.

Using good information to make decisions as needed is an essential part of the
scientific method. In the scientific method, you propose a hypothesis, design
a test to confirm or disprove the hypothesis, perform the test, and _draw
conclusions based on all the available evidence_. To draw a conclusion is
simply to make a decision about the probable truth or falsehood of a
hypothesis. 400 years of modern science has shown that this method works
remarkably well. Planning is essentially drawing conclusions without
performing the experiments, thereby leaving out key information. It's simply
bad practice.

Moreover, recursive planning is dynamic and keeps you from planning out work
you'll never actually do. It makes no sense to design 8 months of experiments
when the first minor test might invalidate the entire line of reasoning. Work
through one decision at a time, including conclusions and information gleaned
from all the previous experiments, tests, and decisions you've made. Just
because you haven't designed an experiment doesn't mean you won't need it
eventually, but until then, you can use your time for more valuable things.
This idea is related to a programming concept called [lazy evaluation][7], and
is extremely powerful.

Full-blown plans are good for recurring problems and show up as formulas,
algorithms, and recipes. The rest of the time, context, good information,
record-keeping, and strong problem solving skills will help you make better
decisions than any plan every could.

I've presented only one part of a much bigger picture today. I haven't talked
at all about how to use recursive planning, along with other strategies, to
actually make significant, long-term progress on a paper or Ph.D. Next time,
I'll begin to address that problem in the context of our motivation to do
science in the first place.
