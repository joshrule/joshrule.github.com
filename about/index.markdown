<p>My name is Josh Rule, and I am fascinated by the mind. As our most basic
tool, using our minds well is critical. But, we know so little about how they
actually work that we cannot expect that we use them nearly as well as we
could.</p>

<p>I am also fascinated by experts, especially those in concept-heavy fields
like physics, novel writing, programming, and mathematics. How do world-class
thinkers do what they do, and how did they become so good at it? More
importantly, how have their brains changed to facilitate their expertise?</p>

<p>I hope to spend my life answering these questions and developing tools that
help us augment and even mimic the brains of experts.  These problems are hard,
but not impossible.</p>
