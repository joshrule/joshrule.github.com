![pen and paper from yourresearchsource.com][1]

Today is day six of my second 30-day trial toward great science. Every day,
I'm taking at least 15 minutes before I leave the lab to think about my
research. That's right. I just sit there and think. I'm not browsing the web,
writing code, reading anything, or talking with anyone. It's just a pen, some
paper, and me - thinking.

So, how's it going so far?

#### First, It's Fun

I'm really enjoying this trial. In fact, I've been carving out extra
reflective time outside of work. Asking, "What good things did I do, and can I
do them better?" fires me up and excites me for the work ahead. It may be that
I'm just a geek, but I challenge you to think for a few moments every day for
the next week and then tell me it doesn't leave you feeling good.

Also, progress, success, and achievement are some of my biggest motivators.
Even a glimmer of progress is often enough to keep me going for days. Because
I keep reviewing behaviors, I'm actually seeing consistent positive change,
rather than just bursts of effort and good will here and there. That is, these
reflective periods are increasing my continued success with other habits,
which leaves me even more motivated to keep pursuing them.

#### But, I missed a day

That's right. I didn't remember my reflective time until I was nearly asleep
last Friday. I'd like to blame the lab meeting that closed out the work day,
but the truth is, I just forgot. Bummer!

While I wish I had remembered, I'm not beating myself up over it. One major
lesson I've picked up from 3+ years of reading productivity books and blogs is
that forming new habits is hard. We should work very hard while setting up new
habits, but we shouldn't expect perfection. If you fail, [that's okay][2].
But, figure out if a simple change can prevent future failures of the same
kind.

Probably the most important thing I can share about establishing habits is
that internal motivation is much more powerful than external motivation. We
are more likely to succeed when we want success for our own reasons, than if
we are simply responding to external punishment or reward. Internal motivation
is far more powerful, but often harder to come by. So, when starting a trial
like this one, make sure it's something you want before just diving in head
first. I've wanted to run this trial for a while, because of things I've read
and the example of people I work with. I made sure that internal motivation
was in place before I started.

#### I'm A Living Example

I wrote a couple weeks ago that we need to [think outside our heads][3] by
talking to people, building things, and writing stuff down. I'm a living
example that thinking outside your head is a good idea. During each of my
reflective periods, I pull out a quarter-sheet of paper and fill it up with
the ideas that pop up. As a result, I've discussed many of those ideas with
people this week, and a few have even been implemented already. In the past,
the same sorts of ideas came up in conversations or while I was working. But,
because I didn't write them down, they never saw the light of day. Instead,
they just sat there, taking up mental space, waiting for me to start this
trial.

I've also mentioned that even if you don't do much else with your writing, the
physical act of scrawling things down helps to convince your brain that your
ideas are important and worth mulling over during free time. I've noticed this
week that when I wake up from a daydream, I've usually been thinking about
something from my reflective time. So, if you set aside time to think during
the day, set aside a pen and some paper to go with it. It helps.

#### I need more time for this

The fifteen minute time commitment has been a great way to start this trial.
It's not so long as to be onerous, but it's long enough to review my day
pretty completely.

That said, there's more I want to do with my thinking time than just review my
day. I want to spend some time mulling over the actual science I'm doing. I
want a few minutes each week to look for future research problems and new
questions, or think through the implications of my results. Plus, these
fifteen minutes are beginning to feel like the most useful part of my entire
workday. It seems like that quarter-hour is where a majority of the real work
is getting done. For example, here are just a few of the ideas I scribbled
down during my thinking time yesterday:

*  I've got to let the web serve my desire to do great things, rather than tie myself to it all the time. It's a great tool, but it's _only_ a tool.
*  I should take some time to clarify, before examining any more data, how the phenomenon I'm studying works, and what results I should expect. Science firstâ€¦ data later.
*  Getting to work earlier is a good idea.
*  Outlining for as long as possible seems to give me more and better ideas. Solve later. Get the ideas out there first.

This trial is already bearing significant fruit, so I'm going to extend my
thinking time to between 20 and 30 minutes. I may switch back if I discover
that extra time is unhelpful. Also, I may discover after a week or two that I
simply don't need to review every single day. But, at least for now, I'll be
extending the trial to include more time each day.

#### Long Way to Go

I don't feel like I'm good at thinking, yet. I still have a lot to learn about
using this thinking time well. I've done a lot of problem solving before, but
defining new problems and trying to make myself a more effective scientist are
very different from the problems I solved as an undergrad. This type of
thinking feels challenging, and I want more of it. There's a whole world of
value lying in my very own head if I can just figure out how to see it. The
outcomes I set at the beginning of the trial barely scratch the surface.

#### More than just a 15-minute break

Everything I've written so far today is interesting, and will probably make us
both more effective people. But, this blog is ultimately about doing great
science.

What I have to share on that front isn't so much an answer as a question,
though. I was reading Hamming's [Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics][4]
the other day, and was struck by the thought experiments he performed which
duplicated Galileo's conclusions about falling bodies without ever leaving his
chair. If you can't remember what I'm talking about, I'd encourage to go
review it quickly. If one of the most famous scientific results in history can
be obtained merely by thinking it through carefully, then I wonder how much of
our science should be done just by thinking about it? What is the balance in
science between empirical observations and rational insight?

Based on what I continue to see in the lab, science has much more to do with
careful thinking than experimental data. This idea is big, a bit
counterintuitive, and could be easily misinterpreted, so I'll post in the next
few weeks with more detailed analysis.

I'll be away from the lab until 3 January visiting family, and I won't be
officially running the trial until I get back. So, the next update will be 10
January 2011. I'll still post, just not on the trial itself.

Merry Christmas!
