Explanation is the heart of science. If you want to do great science, you must
be good at explaining things. You must hunger for better explanations, and you
must relentlessly pursue them.

Most of us are neither that deliberate nor that relentless. We may want to
answer the question _why?_ or _how?_, but we grow content too soon. To help
teach myself to hunger after good explanations and to recognize the anatomy of
such an explanation, I've started a 30-day experiment. Each day for 30 days,
I'm writing a 100-word explanation of some key concept in my work. It may be a
very particular concept like congruency in the composite face effect, or it
may be something more general, like the statistical mean.

These early explanations are key to our development, and later mastery, as
scientists. So today, I want to explore how the dense, conceptually simple
explanations this trial pushes for can be used as part of a larger system in
doing great science.

#### Grouping Adds Meaning

Imagine watching a painter at work. Early brushstrokes seem random to you, but
as the painting takes shape, those same brushstrokes now form a key figure in
the painting. Eventually, the painting itself is complete and holds just a few
of these main figures, neatly organizing all those disparate strokes. Instead
of chaos, there is now order.

The same is true of watching a spider spin a web, a construction crew build
the foundation of a skyscraper, or any number of creative tasks. Those early
actions may be well-organized by some unifying vision, but that vision often
doesn't become obvious until later. Note too, that no single brushstroke or
thread of spider silk is interesting in and of itself. It is only in concert
with a host of others that these single items take on significance.

Now, something I find incredibly interesting is that this addition of meaning
is hierarchical. A lone bristle in the brush has the merest impact on the
painting, and even single brushstrokes communicate little. In concert with a
few more strokes, though, it forms part of an interesting, but isolated,
figure. Adding a few of these figures creates a painting and adds more
meaning. Adding a few related paintings creates a series and adds yet more
meaning. Each additional layer tells us more about the world those
brushstrokes represent, and each revelation has the potential to be more
profound and more stunning to the viewer.

#### Even In Science

Again, these observations don't hold just for painting[^1]. They're also
true for us as scientists. Instead of brushstrokes building meaning, we use
explanations themselves to create more complex explanations. The work of
science creates a hierarchy of explanations. Our most basic units of meaning,
those which have the least explanatory power, are observations. We see, feel,
hear, smell, and taste. Instruments like thermometers and fMRI scanners extend
these senses and make them more accurate and precise. But, by themselves, they
do little to explain our world. So, we gather a group of those observations
under some more general explanation. We form theories to explain visual
crowding or the composite face effect. Then, we use those theories to explain
something more general, like vision or even the entire brain. We continue
adding layers to arrive at more and more general explanations, each with more
profound and more breath-taking implications than those before it.

Imagine doing your research without the ability to summarize or use
statistics. Or, imagine programming a computer without access to a high-level
language, using binary alone. These things would be a nightmare because we, as
humans, are not very detail-oriented. Human working memory is limited to about
7 items, so the fewer pieces we have to manipulate at one time, the better.
The fact that explanations can be combined and manipulated to build even
better explanations is wonderful. It means that we can work with these few
general abstractions without losing the support of the observations beneath
them. To put it another way, we get more out of those seven items by making
each item more powerful. By exploiting that limitation, we find incredible
explanatory power.

If we carry this process far enough and distill as much signal as is possible
from all the noise, we're left with the basic laws of the universe. We will
have discovered the [axioms we weren't handed][2].

I've [argued][3] that experts think differently from non-experts because they
explain the world around them differently from non-experts. They've learned to
partition the world in such a way that the pieces they have are superbly
helpful for working in their field. This [chunking][4] allows experts to
create powerful mental tools specially adapted for their work[^2].

For scientists, I'm proposing that a great many of these chunks are the
explanations we develop and master through our research. My hope is that this
trial accelerates the process of developing these explanations. It explicitly
takes malformed but potentially powerful conceptual tools and encourages you
to spend enough time on a small enough concept that you can form and
intuitively wield a potent understanding of it. The end result is a much more
capable scientist.


[^1]: Scientists, programmers, painters, and makers of all sorts have quite a bit in common. Paul Graham has done a great deal of programming and trained in Italy as a painter. His essay, [Hackers and Painters][5], highlights more of the similarities all makers share.
[^2]: Some programming languages lend themselves to creating what's called a domain-specific language. Essentially, you can use the original language to build up a second language perfectly suited to solving a specific set of problems. We're doing something very similar by taking general explanations and combining them into tools perfectly suited for research in our fields. This sort of process is probably what creates most jargon, too.
