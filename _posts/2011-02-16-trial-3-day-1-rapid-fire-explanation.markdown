Mid-way through my last trial on Way of the Scholar (15-minute reflections on
science and my research), [a book][2] I read [reminded me][3] that massive
domain knowledge and intense deliberate practice are perhaps the two most
helpful ways to improve performance, whatever our field. I restructured my
daily reflections to look more like deliberate practice, and I began thinking
about explicitly designing future trials to expand my neuroscience/computer
science/mathematics knowledge base or hone particular research skills. If
those two things form the scientific basis for doing great work, it would be
foolish to ignore them.

So, I'm kicking off my third trial for Way of the Scholar today, and it's the
first I've explicitly designed around the concept of deliberate practice. Over
the next 30 days, I'll write 30 100-word explanations of keystone concepts in
my research[^1].

#### What Do You Mean by Trial?

I run 30-day experiments, or trials, to physically test my ideas about doing
[great science][4]. These trials also provide a platform for honing my skills
as a scientist in parallel with my actual research. Using a few minutes each
day to actively get better at what I do makes the rest of my work much more
effective. 30 days is somewhat arbitrary, but gives me time to settle into a
routine and let a habit evolve slightly before deciding if it's worth
maintaining.

Long-term, my hope is that these trials form an arsenal of habits that other
new scientists can use to more quickly and explicitly develop helpful skills
and do great science. I want to do the legwork that makes your journey toward
great science easier. We need your good work as soon as possible.

#### Trial 3: Summarizing Keystone Concepts

Two weeks ago, I gave an informal talk about a paper closely tied to my work.
The results were highly relevant and seemed well motivated, but they hinged on
several ideas that took 2-3 afternoons of auxiliary research for me to
understand intuitively. It's not that they were poorly presented or wrongly
used. It's just that they were keystone concepts. By that, I mean that without
them, the rest of the paper didn't make much sense. They were needed to give
structure and meaning to the rest of the explanations and experiments, just
like the keystone in an arch holds the rest of the arch's stones in place.

I took time to understood these ideas intuitively, but ignored the need to
prepare concise explanations of them. So, I struggled to share my
understanding, and the rest of the talk confused everyone. Without those
keystone concepts, nothing else made sense. To do great science, we must both
internalize _and_ communicate the central observations of both our work _and_
the work of others.

Enter Trial 3. It's designed to solve exactly the problem I experienced a
couple weeks ago, and it's the first trial that I've built around this idea of
deliberate practice. Specifically, I'm hunting down 30 keystone concepts from
my work and closely related science. Some will come from mathematics, some
from neuroscience, and some from computer science. The field itself doesn't
matter nearly as much as the idea's helpfulness to my research. Each day, I'll
take one of these concepts and boil it down to a potent 100-word explanation
that's as complete as possible.

For example, here's today's summary. In 91 words, it explains a keystone idea
used to study the composite face effect[^2].

> congruency: Congruency measures face-half origin and is the theoretically
> basic metric for the composite face effect (CFE). Halves originating from the
> same face yield a congruency of 1 and disparate halves yield 0. It's the basic
> measure of the CFE because:
>
>   1. Congruent faces yield better sensitivity than incongruent faces on CFE
>   tasks, due to either holistic processing or an inability to modulate spatial
>   attention. Failing to differentiate these alternatives is congruency's major
>   flaw.
>
>   2. Congruency doesn't require arbitrary transformations that may affect
>   holistic processing like inversion, misalignment, or frequency analysis.

#### Wait, Explain That Again

At its heart, science is about [producing good explanations][5]. It seems
likely that one of the best things you can do as a new scientist is to develop
your skills as an explainer. You need to become fluent in the art of
explaining. You need to know what a good explanation feels like, what it's
made of, and how its parts interact to produce a compelling and likely
explanation. The best way I know to do all these things is to practice
building your own explanations, and that's what trial 3 does. It gives us a
daily platform for building explanations.

By reading the explanations of other scientists and condensing them into a
personal summary, my hope is that this trial allows only the essential parts
of those explanations to survive. Over time, this process should highlight the
general anatomy of an explanation, making you more skilled at identifying
which parts of an explanation are essential, and which can be safely ignored.
Knowing that makes it much easier to decipher unfamiliar explanations in other
people's research.

Even better, explanation isn't the only skill this trial targets.

*  100 words makes for a compact summary, so it will force you to make each word earn its spot in your writing. 
*  The end product of this trial will be 30 well-explained keystone ideas. Each of those ideas can also be thought of as a strand in a web of domain knowledge, with each idea connected to many related ideas. The more ideas we have, and the better they're connected, the easier it is to insert new ideas. 

Trial 3 begins today, and I'll probably post updates once every two weeks or
so. At least one good friend will be doing this trial with me, and I'd love
for you to join me, too. If you do, [let me know][6].
In the mean time, I'll continue looking at the fundamental biases
wrapped up in the scientific method.


[^1]: Those 30 days are days that I'm in the lab. So, instead of lasting 4 weeks, my 30-day trials usually last 6 weeks, because I don't work on weekends or holidays.
[^2]: This summary may not make much sense to you. One key trait of this trial is that I'm building _personal_ summaries. They rely heavily on ideas I understand well and connect strongly to my central research themes. If you do this trial on your own, don't build explanations as if you're writing for an encyclopedia. Write for yourself - give yourself the ability to explain your ideas clearly to others by building on things you know well.
