From the very first post, I've been writing about how to repeatedly do great
science. But, I waited to actually [define science][2] until just a few weeks
ago. And, I've waited until today to talk about what separates great science
from all the rest.

Why the wait? My past definitions were all off just a little bit off. I wasn't
sure why, but every time I thought I had a definition nailed down, something
didn't feel quite right. Over the past couple of weeks, the problem has
continued to bug me, and I finally have something I'm fairly confident is
correct.

Before continuing, remember our working definition of science: **science is an
attempt to provide the most likely explanation of everything.** If you haven't
read [the post][2] explaining that definition, I encourage you to do so now.

#### Getting a Handle on Greatness

The word _great_ is one of the [150 most commonly used English words][3], so
providing an exhaustive explanation is out of the question. But, I like the
way [Wikipedia][4] describes greatness, saying that it's, "A state of
superiority," with "clear and perceivable advantage." Greatness can't be
significantly improved. Many times, the greatest work is provably optimal.

**Greatness is a state of superiority with clear and perceivable, even optimal, advantage.**

My usual caveats about definitions apply. I'm not trying to give a bullet-
proof analysis of greatness or great science. Language collapses on itself if
you push too hard. I'm outlining a vision for why we're thinking about great
science at all. What are we aiming for? What's so interesting about doing
great science?

#### Great Science Explained

How do we put great and science together to get great science? Well, science
is in the business of providing likely explanations. Great science should do
that significantly better than the run-of-the-mill version. So, here's the
definition to stick on a notecard and read every morning:

**Great Science:**
*  **radically confirms that existing science is right** and/or
*  **turns the world on its head by giving it a dramatically better explanation than it's ever had.**

This first type of great science is basically the pinnacle of the scientific
method. Existing science makes a prediction that can only be true if the
existing theory is true. Scientists search and search, and eventually someone
finds a way of verifying that hypothesis. That verification is great science,
because it makes the existing theory incredibly likely. It gives us a strong
reason to bank on the existing science in future research. As I understand it,
a lot of advances in theoretical and particle physics happen this way.

For the second type of great science, think of Copernicus. The entire
civilized world thought that the sun, moon, and stars spun around the earth (1
out of 3 isn't bad, is it?). He came in and provided some incredibly strong
evidence that the current science did a terrible job explaining things
compared to his new model, that the earth revolved around the sun. Barring
some strange religious intolerance, the world has been celebrating the
[Copernican Revolution][5] ever since.

No definition of great science holds water if it doesn't count discoveries
that solve the world's urgent problems. If anything could qualify as great
science, it would be a cure for cancer. So, notice something similar about the
world's urgent physical problems[^1]. At their heart is a gaping void
waiting for an explanation. Solving the world's problems requires that
explanation. It requires great science.

That's exactly the case with cancer. We haven't cured cancer because there's
something we fundamentally don't understand about it - how to stop it without
killing the living body around it. The person who makes the discovery needed
to destroy cancer will be hailed, not just for saving the world from a
terrible disease, but for the theoretical breakthrough that made it possible.

#### Great Science Comes From All Corners

With all this talk about explanation and theory, we must be careful not to
idolize the ivory tower. Many fields in science were created explicitly to
support a concrete invention or marvel of engineering. And, much of the early
work was done by the very engineers and programmers building the systems.
Think of the incredible science done specifically by the people who physically
built the atomic bomb or the algorithms running the web. Seeing a chink in the
armor of the unknown is hard, and we reward a successful attack as great
science, no matter who does it.

Even with a clear definition, great science is often hard to judge. Footnotes
sometimes go on to win the Nobel Prize, and celebrated theories often fall
quickly by the wayside. Just look at the massive graveyard of rejected
theories in psychology. Skinner and Freud are interesting historically, but
their theories were shown the door a long time ago.

No matter who does it and no matter the pomp and circumstance (or lack
thereof), _we want to pursue great science by explaining the world better or
making our explanations more likely_.

#### Great Scientists And The Ten-Foot Pole

I need to make a quick clarification, so please read this paragraph carefully.
I'm here to talk about doing great _science_, and I deliberately avoid claims
about the process of becoming a great _scientist_. In fact, I've gone through
this week and removed any reference to great scientists in past posts.

Labeling a person is much trickier than judging a piece of work as good or
bad. And, I'm just not prepared to tackle that sort of discussion, nor do I
want to confuse it with the relatively simple idea of doing great work.

Now, I do hope that you become a great person. The world could use more of
them. I even hope that this site might have some small part in pushing you
toward greatness. But, I'll do it by showing you how to do the work, not by
giving you a label.

#### What's Next?

So, we're shooting to provide explanations which are clearly superior, even
optimal, in their likelihood or explanatory power. We know the following:

*  our [biases are a critical part of finding good explanations][6] and demand careful consideration. 
*  [Great science doesn't happen randomly][7], but takes significant work over several years. 
*  It depends more on [the way we think and approach problems][8] than on the physical tools we use. 
*  [Deliberate practice and extensive knowledge][9] are two of our biggest conceptual tools for consistent improvement. 

We need to continue examining bias, uncovering the tools used by those doing
great science, and putting our findings into practice. On Monday, I'll be
doing just that, writing one of the last updates for my 30-day experiment to
spend 15 minutes each day thinking explicitly about my research.

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!


[^1]: I say physical problems because there are some problems that science will never solve. Determining our most basic biases cannot be done scientifically, because the very ability to do science depends on having some biases already in place. This is a big issue, though, far too big for a footnote.
