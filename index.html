            <p class="about">I am a postdoctoral scholar with <a href="http://colala.berkeley.edu/people/piantadosi">Steven Piantadosi</a> and <a href="http://alisongopnik.com">Alison Gopnik</a> at <a href="https://berkeley.edu">UC, Berkeley</a>.

            <p>My research uses behavioral experiments and computational methods to study how people develop conceptual systems and leverage them to accomplish their goals. My work revolves around an idea called <a href="papers/rule2020childb.pdf">the child as hacker</a>&mdash;that symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations and that learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">hacking</a>. I am particularly interested in understanding how human programmers write code–all the goals, activities, and tools people use to make code better–and applying these insights to better describe learning in children and adults.

                I completed my PhD with <a href="https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh">Josh Tenenbaum</a> at <a href="https://mit.edu">MIT</a> <a href="papers/joshua_s_rule_thesis.pdf">My thesis</a> (<a href="papers/joshua_s_rule_thesis_precis.pdf">precis</a>) introduced the child as hacker hypothesis and tested it in a large-scale study of human and machine concept learning.
