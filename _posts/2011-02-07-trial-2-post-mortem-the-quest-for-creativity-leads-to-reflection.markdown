For the past 30 days I've been in the lab, I've spent at least 15 minutes each
day reflecting on some aspect of my research. Find the rest of the posts in
the [archive][2].

Over the past week-and-a-half, I've kept thinking about this trial and talking
Amy's ear off about it, trying to find the central reason I've felt that this
trial is so important[^1]. That reason is the following:

**Reflection is closely tied to the formation of great explanations: without time to reflect, you will not create great explanations.**

#### A Walk in the Park, This Isn't

Regularly producing great science is hard. It's not the sort of thing you
knock off on a Saturday afternoon. And, it's not just that it requires a lot
of time. Doing great science is genuinely hard.

But why?

Are we running out of things to discover?
: Until I have teleportation, the ability to materialize my wildest imaginations
out of thin air, and an engaging but artificially intelligent conversation
partner, we're nowhere close to running out of things to discover.

Did past generations take the easy stuff?
: Heliocentrism, the human genome, and relativity may be well-established
science now, but they were revolutionary work when they came out. Given the
physical and theoretical tools available, none of those discoveries were easy.

Are we getting dumber?
: We use yesterday's great discoveries to leverage our way into today's unknown.
Newton's calculus, Turing's machine, and a host of explanations that defined
the great work of past generations are the foundation for our current work.
Our problems are more complex, and our explanations more convincing than ever.
  
[Great science][3] requires new explanations or radical confirmation of
existing explanations. It doesn't get churned out like costume jewelry. Each
great explanation is a rare jewel. Finding them and cutting away their
imperfections is a hard task, specialized to the unique item at hand.

So, the reason great science was, is, and will continue to be hard is that it
requires significant creativity. No matter where the curtain of the unknown
falls, it shrouds everything beyond it. And, everything that's already been
tried to move that curtain hasn't worked. Something new is required for
progress, and only remarkable creativity or dumb luck gives us a chance to
peer past the unknown and see some way forward. You can't rely on random luck,
by definition. So, great science is typically the work of creative genius.

Fortunately, genius and creativity aren't reserved for the innately brilliant
of the inherently artistic. They require brilliance and artistry, but those
are learned traits. People are not born amazingly skilled. They're born slimy
and screaming. The ability to do great science is learned over time.

So, let's take a deeper look at what we need to develop significant
creativity.

#### Creativity Comes Through Connected Knowledge

First, creativity requires knowing enough to see the world differently from
non-experts. You've got to know what might work, what won't work, and be able
to see the problem from every possible angle. For increasingly sophisticated
questions, that requires increasingly clear thinking and a ballooning
knowledge base[^2]. In fact, expert-level knowledge changes the way your
brain thinks about a problem. That's been confirmed in studies of master
[chess-][4] and [shogi-players][5], and it's been shown for [physics
professors][6], too. If an expert physicist's brain adapts to make him a
better problem-solver, I'd guess our brains will change for our research, too.
Extensive knowledge reorganizes our world, and gives us a platform for
creativity others can't reach.

Second, creativity requires a well-developed ability to make connections. Now,
our brains make and break an incredible number of connections between ideas
and experiences every day. But, a lot of those connections seem fairly random,
hence my dreams about needing to empty dryer lint trays to get my church's
sound system running again. We've got to slowly train ourselves to make
relevant connections. We need to move away from randomness, and toward the
sorts of connections that actually solve problems. Primarily, this comes from
experience solving problems in your field. Paul Graham writes in [one of his
essays][7] about his time studying painting in Italy. He said that over time,
the random lines in his doodling looked more and more like the strokes he
would use to paint. Similarly, the more we solve problems like those in our
field, the more easily we find the relevant connections that generate new
explanations and powerful predictions.

Generating new, creative explanations relies largely on our understanding of
the problem, and our skill in generating connections. Creativity isn't a
shrouded and ineffable mystery. It's hard work applied over time.

**Creativity is nothing more than rightly applying extensive knowledge.**

#### To Be Creative, Reflect

When you understand creativity this way, long periods of reflection naturally
fall out. Without them, there's not enough time to organize problems in a
helpful way. There's not enough time to shrug off old biases or draw seemingly
disparate facts together. The right connections won't be made, and the wrong
ones won't be broken.

Creating great explanations takes time. It doesn't matter how much you know
about particle physics or neurobiology if you spend all day jumping through
administrative hoops and writing grant proposals. Without time devoted to
thinking about problems, you simply won't make significant progress.
Explaining the theoretical foundations of the universe just doesn't happen in
the 10-minute gap between committee meetings that you also use to pick up
lunch, stop in the bathroom, and check email.

Reflection gives you a chance to organize and apply your domain knowledge to a
specific problem, and it's one of the first steps to producing great
explanations.

Perhaps I'm sounding trivial. "Of course we need time to solve problems," you
might argue, "That's why we go to work all day, right?" Why else would we do
science if we didn't want to spend time explaining? Well, I worked at a lab
for several months before starting this trial. I thought I was making
significant progress in my understanding and really getting my head around the
research. I was reading papers, running simulations, and participating in lab
meetings, and it seemed great.

But, reading papers and running experiments are not the same as advancing your
understanding of a problem. One adds to your knowledge base, and the other
gives you space to apply that knowledge to a particular explanation. So, don't
get me wrong; we need paper reading and experiment running. But, we also need
time to think, apart from anything else.

That's right - great science demands time away from everything else.
Reflection happens when you isolate yourself with nothing but a place to catch
your thoughts and perhaps a little data. If you want, feel free to bring a
friend, because you'll probably think more clearly with help. But, leave
behind your experiments, half-read papers, meetings, Internet connection, and
administrivia. Go think about explaining the world.

World-changing explanations move forward where there is no path. Deciding how
to blaze the trail requires careful thinking. The creative work of finding the
way ahead is why great science demands reflection.

#### And Now, Something Completely Different

I love writing Way of the Scholar, and I want to provide you with the most
helpful ideas that I can. There's a deep need for clear thinking about
science. So, I'll be dropping from two posts a week to three posts every two
weeks. Instead of Monday and Thursday each week, expect them Monday, Friday,
and Wednesday every two weeks. I'm really excited about this change, because
it will help me pack even better ideas into each post.

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this new schedule, and as always, I'm
available over [Twitter][8].

Thanks for reading, and have a great day[^3]!


[^1]: My wife, Amy, should probably be listed as Way of the Scholar's co-author. She helps me edit every post, and she's an absolutely wonderful sounding board. She encourages me when my writing's terrible, and she cuts me back down to size when I think I'm brilliant. If Way of the Scholar has been at all helpful to you, it's has a lot to do with Amy.
[^2]: In fact, as problems grow increasingly complex, great science is done by expanding our knowledge base not only to include more of our field, but more of other fields, too. For a great example, the recent [Afek _et al._ paper][9], which solves a difficult theoretical computer science problem by mimicking the brain of a fruit fly.
[^3]: If you've gotten this far and are still wondering, "When is he going to address the hypotheses from the first trial report?" then I'm sorry. I'm not. Those initial hypotheses don't reflect what I've learned very well, and spending the post going over them seemed like it would shortchange the other ideas I've had. If you really want to know, all four initial hypotheses were confirmed, but I'm still in the process of putting together a written description of my work.
