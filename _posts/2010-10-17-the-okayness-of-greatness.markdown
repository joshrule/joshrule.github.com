I recently re-read a transcript of Richard Hamming's _[You and Your
Research][1]_. If you haven't read it, do so soon. It is one of the most
useful pieces on doing great scholarship I've ever read. One thing Hamming
repeatedly stresses is the importance of setting out to do great work.

Early on in the talk, he says,

> I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, "Yes, I would like to
> do first-class work." Our society frowns on people who set out to do really
> good work. You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you
> do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say,
> why shouldn't you set out to do something significant. You don't have to tell
> other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, "Yes, I would like to do
> something significant\[?\]"

And, he's right. The desire to do great research, or anything great, _is_
often looked down upon as hubris. But, that's a mistake. The danger of
academic hubris lies instead in using our work as a lever to buoy our personal
reputation. The path to ego gratification is very different and far easier
than the one that generates significant, life-changing, world-bettering
research. So, when we face tough choices, we nearly always choose personal
short-term glory over long-term benefit for the world. Instead of publishing
when something truly significant and helpful develops, you're encouraged to
inflate results and churn out papers which, in the final analysis, don't say
much more than that you tied your shoe last Thursday and found a penny on the
walk home. Instead of great science, this route leads to excessive strutting
and feather-preening and should be avoided.

Instead, we should dwell on and internalize the many good reasons for pursuing
great research.

First, great science builds a better world. We didn't go to the moon,
eliminate smallpox, or develop modern supercomputers by being afraid to go
after something great. Relativity, calculus, and universal gravitation are not
the result of pride or narcissism. Someone or a group of someones took on an
important problem, and the results have dramatically enriched our world.

Second, shooting for anything less than great work is an active handicap. Most
of the time, solutions to the world's most important problems don't look like
the solutions to related but less important problems. Vaccines look nothing
like brandy and a cold cloth, and if we kept treating the symptoms, we would
never cure the disease. Solving only moderately important problems nearly
guarantees that we won't find solutions to the problems causing the greatest
harm to our planet and our neighbors.

Third, we are designed to do great work and will be wrongly stressed if we
don't. My water bottle is designed for a specific purpose, to hold water. If I
instead use it to drive nails or chop down a tree, I will do a poor job and
crush the bottle into a lump of scrap metal. Using tools against their design
stresses them the wrong way, and they quickly degrade. Using our minds and
bodies for anything less than great work keeps them from running as well as
they could. They, too, will quickly degrade. And, that means that by aiming
for less than great work, we rob the world of some of the benefit we could
have given. Without serious justification, that's an incredibly selfish thing
to do and in very poor taste.

Now, there's a lot that remains to be said about pursuing great
research[^1]. For example, it's hard, it takes years to develop the
necessary skills, and there are many fields where we cannot become great
because of limits in our biology or background. In fact, I haven't even given
a proper definition for what it means to do great work (that's coming soon).
But, the point I want you to get from this post is that aiming to do great
science is admirable if we set out to do the best that we can to build a
better world.


[^1]: And in support of pursuing it. The reasons I have given are some of the best, but they are by no means the only valid justifications for great science.
