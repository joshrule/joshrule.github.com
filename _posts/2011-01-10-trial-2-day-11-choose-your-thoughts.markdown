![neuroscience is like the wild west - by Wolfgang Staudt on flickr.com][1]

Today's post is a progress report on my current trial. For 30 days, I'm
setting aside at least 15 minutes each day explicitly for thinking about
science and my research. Because I took time off over the holidays, today is
day 11 out of 30.

#### Crystal in the Wild West

My principal investigator recently told me that neuroscience is a lot like the
Wild West right now. There are few dominant theories and plenty of wide, open
space for anyone to conquer, provided they have a few good ideas and the
ability to execute them. He's not the first neuroscientist to tell me that,
either.

I'd guess that most relatively new fields share this trait and present a great
deal of opportunity for developing scientists. It's in exactly this sort of
atmosphere that an experiment like this thinking time trial is most necessary.
Here, I'm not just inching along a path that's been pretty clearly set out by
the work that's come before me. My research actually bushwhacks a tiny trail
into the unknown that may eventually become a main thoroughfare for the field
(or it may be a forgotten path down which a lonely hermit livesâ€¦).

The incredible freedom new fields present requires extremely clear thinking to
get much out of them. Because not much has been established, there's also not
much recourse when you run into problems. Regularly setting time aside to
reflect on your work and how it relates to your field seems like a critical
skill to develop[^1]. I'm not saying it's unimportant for established
fields like physics or analytic chemistry, but it's especially important for
scientists in developing fields.

#### The Importance of Habits

I've noticed that the thinking itself is still pretty hard from day to day. I
expect that good thinking will always be hard. Otherwise, someone else would
have done it earlier.

But, it's becoming increasingly automatic to actually take time each day for
thinking. In fact, I'm beginning to set aside additional thinking time to
consider things that aren't tied directly to my research.

For example, an opportunity arose last week that, if it works out, will open
up some great research for me, but will also require significantly more time.
I quickly started outlining the pros and cons of the opportunity and asking
myself some pretty tough questions about it. A few weeks ago, I doubt that I
would have done anything like that. I probably would have worried a bit,
quickly talked it over with my wife, and made a decision. I have a much
clearer head about the decision I actually made because I took time to think
through it more carefully.

This sort of reflective thinking is a skill requiring hard work over time to
develop. But, setting aside the time to learn it is easy, and there's lots of
material on the web to help you learn how to do it. Leo Babauta's
[ZenHabits][2] has some great advice about habit formation, as does his site
[6Changes][3]. I also highly recommend Cal Newport's thoughts on [deliberate
practice][4], [churn rate][5], and the [failed simulation effect][6].

#### Choose Carefully

I should warn you, though, that it's especially important for this trial that
you spend your time carefully. Choosing the right sorts of things to think
about is crucial. For example, I spent my first two months at Way of the
Scholar thinking mostly about being a productive and effective person. As a
result, most of the posts discussed some aspect of being productive and
effective generally. And, while that's important, it's not the reason I
started Way of the Scholar. I'm here to talk about science and doing it
unbelievably well. But, because I chose the wrong thing to think about, my
brain was tied up with the wrong problems.

I'm noticing the same thing in this trial. I've spent the last eleven days
thinking primarily about workflow and how I'm spending my time in the lab. As
a result, I've made some helpful changes. But, my brain is spending its free
time working through problems with how I spend my time, rather than through
questions about my research[^2].

I've defaulted to what I know well, personal productivity, and not what I want
to know better, neuroscience. What I know well is easy to think about. I'm
basically tweaking and optimizing an already established routine based on a
fairly deep pool of knowledge. What I want to know better requires moving
through unknown territory. It's more rewarding, but the unknown element also
makes it seem much harder. It may not actually be harder, but it sure does
seem like it.

So, for the next couple of weeks, I'll be trying to think much more
deliberately about my research.

I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I've got to do it. So, I'm going to
start by thinking about three major questions:

*  What question am I trying to answer with this research? 
*  Why am I trying to answer that question?
*  What information would most clearly answer that question? 

My research picks up where someone left off before I arrived at the lab, so a
good deal of the answers lie in my simulation code. But I haven't articulated
those answers myself very well, and I've confused myself several times while
modifying the simulations. Explicit answers would be extremely helpful.

Next week, I'll report back with what I've found. On Thursday, though, I'll
continue our series exploring the fundamentals of science and talk a bit about
why someone might want to use their life advancing science.

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!


[^1]: I've mentioned it before, but Richard Hamming did the exact same thing during the early days of computer science. He spent roughly 10% of his working time thinking about the future of computers, the sorts of tools people would need, and the sorts of things computers would and wouldn't ever do. He claimed it was one of his most helpful practices.
[^2]: But, I'd guess that if I got my brain working on research problems, my spare time would be less of a problem, because I'd use it to work out solutions I'd thought of earlier.
