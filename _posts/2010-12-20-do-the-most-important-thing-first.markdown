Yesterday, I read [a remarkable piece by Sebastian Marshall][2] talking about
the Internet. It's a repository of fascinating things and is growing so fast
that no one could possibly hope to keep up with it. For someone like me who's
curious to a fault, that makes the web one of the most wonderful things in the
world. I always have something new to discover. It also makes it one of the
most dangerous. I always have new distractions (as if the old ones weren't bad
enough). In fact, during my last [period of reflection][3] I wrote, "\[The\]
Internet is KILLER!"

But, the Internet and its merry band of distractions can be beaten - easily.
Today, I want to outline the only strategy you'll need to send the Internet
and its ilk packing. **Do the most important thing first**.

#### What?

If I take everything I might want to do at any given moment, and throw it into
a list, all sorts of things will appear on that list. Some of those things
will have a big impact on my research. Some will have a big impact on my
marriage and family relationships or one of my hobbies. Some will just soak up
time without giving back any lasting value.

Beating distractions is as simple as picking the most important thing on the
list and working on it until it is done or no longer the most important thing
on the list. By important, I mean _helpful in my long-term plans to build a
better world_. When you finish the most important thing, don't jump straight
to your inbox. Otherwise, you'll only get one useful thing done all day. Find
the most important thing on what's left of the list and do that. Turning this
process into a way of thinking, rather than just a daily routine, is where
most of the power lies. Also, add to the list as new work arrives.

If the most important thing on my list is running a new simulation, then I
should start with that when I get to the lab. I'm not saying I won't browse
the web later. I'm just saying that I won't browse the web until it's the most
important thing on my list.

The reason this strategy kills our most dangerous distractions is that those
distractions are rarely important. They may be interesting, but they're almost
never that useful for our work. So, they just sit at the bottom of the list,
not distracting you, while you go on finishing the most important thing at the
top of the list.

If you still find yourself sneaking back to distractions every once in a
while, don't get frustrated. Just guide yourself back to the most important
thing. This kind of focus doesn't get perceptibly easier over time, but you do
get better at it, nonetheless.

#### Distractions and Gardening

Don't remove something from the list which seems like a distraction now, just
because it's a distraction. Important work and distractions are nearly the
same thing. The only difference between them is a matter of perspective.

To some, violets are weeds, because they're not supposed to grow in corn
fields. To others, a nice bed of violets forms the centerpiece of their entire
garden. Whether something is a weed or a flower is just a matter of
perspective. Whether something is a distraction or important work is likewise
a matter of perspective.

When I'm at the lab, things like email and Twitter are distractions. I work at
the lab to discover new things about the brain, not to chat with friends. But,
when I'm at home, I'm there to be away from the lab. Not that I don't like the
lab, but rest is key to maximizing my impact there. So, running experiments or
reading papers would be distractions from what I go home to do - connect with
my wife and friends, pursue some hobbies, and try to make sense of my place in
the world. Things like email and Twitter suddenly become more important, and
sometimes they are the most important thing on my list [^1].

#### Does it Really Help?

The short answer is, "Yes, it helps immensely."

On a more practical level, doing the important work first provides your work
day with unbelievable focus. Everything I work on plays a role in moving
valuable projects forward. So, the time I devote to science each day actually
gets used on science. As a result, work gets done, and lots of it. I've said
before (following [Tim Ferriss][4], who follows Pareto) that many of us manage
only 2 hours of solid work for each 8-hour day we put on the clock.
Distractions balloon up to fill the other 6 hours. By cutting those out
entirely, we can more than double our working time to that [4.5 hours][5] Tony
Schwartz suggests.

But, because we actually get an extraordinary amount of work done in a
relatively short period of time, we can leave the lab a few hours early, go
sit in a cafe and let our brain work out some of our nagging problems over a
cup of coffee with a friend. Work more in less time, and spend the rest of
your day doing other things you also enjoy. That sounds ideal.

Also, as focusing on important things becomes a habit, you actually have more
time to think about problems. So, you develop a capacity to think more deeply
about them. You learn how to probe a problem and look for pieces that don't
make sense. You find the bits which are actually hard to understand, and toss
out false constraints. You quickly rack up problem solving time and become
increasingly good at actually solving them. As a result, you work through
problems more quickly, new problems present themselves, and the cycle repeats.
Doing the most important thing first stresses the heart of scientific problem
solving and ignores everything else.

#### A Long Way To Go

When it comes to doing the important work first, I've made plenty of mistakes.
I've frittered away lots of time in the lab and at home on things I find
interesting or humorous, but which ultimately make little impact on me and do
little to drive me toward building a better world. But, over the past couple
of weeks, I've begun to pay more attention to my most important work, and it's
starting to show.
