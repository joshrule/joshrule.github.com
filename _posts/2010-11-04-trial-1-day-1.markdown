Today, I’m kicking off the first of many experiments to come for Way of the
Scholar. Specifically, I’m starting a 30-day trial to read academically for at
least an hour each day.

#### 30-Day Trials

The 30-day trial is a simple concept. For 30 days, I’ll add something to my
todo list each morning, and I won’t go to sleep until that something gets done[^1].
Every week, I’ll use one post to report my progress and further
explain how this particular trial relates to the strategies we’ve been
discussing in other posts. I’ll probably write occasional updates on Twitter,
too. After 30 days, I will write up my conclusions and recommendations based
on the trial’s results.

The things we do affect the way we think, and vice versa. So, posts dedicated
to 30-day trials will look at how behavior changes my thinking and uses
several strategies simultaneously. Posts dedicated to a specific strategy will
look more closely at the benefits of that particular strategy and how it may
be tied to a variety of behaviors. So, in both types of posts we’re looking at
the relation between mental habits and greater effectiveness; we’re just doing
it from different angles.

These 30-day trials won’t produce peer-reviewable findings. Right now, I’m the
only subject, and the only control available is myself before the trial, so my
results have only anecdotal power[^2]. But, I will try to set clear
definitions and clear goals for each trial, so that we can gauge the overall
success of the experiment at least somewhat objectively. And, if I can find
related research findings that have been peer-reviewed, I will be sure to
include them.

Also, I am conducting only one trial at a time to minimize interactions
between trials and keep my schedule manageable. I may run other sorts of
experiments in the future, but at least for now, I’ll be using experiment and
trial interchangeably.

#### The First Trial

My first trial will be to spend at least an hour each day reading academically
in my field. Blogs and links from Hacker News don’t count as academic reading,
and neither do books I’m reading for pleasure. Instead, I want to read
academic papers and textbooks about neuroscience, particularly computational
neuroscience, for no fewer than 60 minutes each day.

I love to read; that’s not the problem. The problem is that I have a weak
background in neuroscience, and practically a doctorate in distraction. I
spent a couple years studying artificial intelligence, and I took 2 psychology
classes as an undergraduate. But, I’ve taken absolutely no neuroscience, and
I’ve spent a lot of time surfing random web pages.

So, the hypotheses of the experiment are three-fold. I think this trial will
do the following:

*  continue to nurture my interest in neuroscience into a passion
*  help identify the important questions in my field
*  weed distractions from my workday

In an [earlier post][2], I mentioned that passion for our work exhibits itself
partially in how well we know our field. The better we know and understand our
work, the better position we are in to really love our field by making the
right decisions to advance it. For someone with as little background as I
have, the implication is pretty clear: start learning as much as you possibly
can about your field. Reading is one of the most obvious ways for me to do
that. Because I am currently situated in a lab, I will continue to read papers
relevant to the lab. But, I am also planning to work through an introductory
textbook and some pieces not directly related to my lab’s research. As
valuable as depth will be for my current work, I also need enough breadth that
I understand the lab’s work with respect to the rest of the field and even the
rest of science.

In Hamming’s _[You and Your Research][3]_, one of his biggest strategies for
doing great work is to work on the most important questions in your field[^3].
I’d love to do that, but first, I need to understand what those
questions are and why they are so important. With better orientation comes an
increased ability to see the important questions in the field and an increased
ability to understand your work strategically. That is, with a better mental
map of your field, you have a better chance of understanding what strategies
would actually be useful for your work and how they might be expressed as
particular tactics.

Another hypothesis for this experiment is that I will spend less time each day
surfing the web and wasting time. By carving out a large block for directed
reading, the small pockets of time wasted on the Internet (which add up to
hours each day), will have less opportunity to materialize. That entire hour
will be distraction-free. I’ll also be watching to see if a block of intense
concentration each morning helps me maintain better concentration throughout
the rest of the day. My guess is that it will.

#### And So It Begins

I’ve started my 30 days today, 4 November 2010 with a nice refresher on some
basic brain biology. I’d love for you to join me by reading about your field
for an hour each day for 30 days, with an eye toward the important questions.
I’ll report next Thursday as to how the experiment is progressing. In the mean
time, I’ll write about an important academic strategy, thievery.


[^1]: Although the 30-day trial is a common concept, I got the idea primarily from Steve Pavlina’s [30-day trial][4] on [raw food][5] and [this post][6] by Dan Lucraft.
[^2]: If you’d like to join any of my 30-day trials, let me know. I’d love to have your input on the design of the trials, and I’d certainly love a larger sample group for drawing conclusions. Also, if you know a good way to measure background knowledge, please let me know.
[^3]: I’m building on what I already know about doing good scholarship, and Hamming’s talk is one of the best things I’ve been able to find. So, I’ll be referencing it a lot these first few months.
