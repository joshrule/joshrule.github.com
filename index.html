        <p>I work as a research assistant under <a href="http://maxlab.neuro.georgetown.edu">Dr. Maximilian Riesenhuber</a> at Georgetown University. I'm currently involved in several projects revolving around <a href="http://maxlab.neuro.georgetown.edu/hmax">HMAX</a>, which models the first 200ms of human visual object recognition.</p>

	<p>My primary research interests are in using computational models along with behavioral and neuroimaging experiments (ex. fMRI, EEG) to better understand human skill-acquisition and expert performance. I'm especially interested in the development of cognitive skills and expertise required in fields like mathematics, writing, the sciences, and computer programming. In short, I want to understand how skills shape thoughts, especially for the most skilled.</p>
