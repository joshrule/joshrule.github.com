Today’s post marks a transition for Way of the Scholar. It might seem a bit
early for a transition - after all, this is only the ninth post. But,
everything so far has been just a preface, and today’s post, the symbolic
zeroth post, is the official introduction to Way of the Scholar.

#### What have we done?

Previously, we established three major facts which will be taken as given from
here on out.

*  First, becoming remarkably effective is not a random process. It requires a deliberate desire to do great work.
*  Second, wanting to do great work which dramatically improves the world is a good thing.
*  Third, effectiveness is not a mystery, but an interaction between three components: efficiency, passion, and a good collection of strategies.

We talked about a number of other things, too, but these are the most
important. These represent where I am on the road to great science. Way of the
Scholar begins here, with a blueprint for being impressively effective at
practically anything within the bounds of our background and biology.

#### What is Way of the Scholar?

Way of the Scholar exists to apply that blueprint to one very specific
problem: transforming an average person into someone doing great science for
the world. If I tried to continue exploring what it took to do great work in
general, rather than great science specifically, I doubt I would get very far
with either. Instead of discovering and sharing concrete and helpful
information, I would probably write posts full of exciting but ultimately
empty advice. I don’t want to do that, so I am focusing specifically on what
it takes to do great science.

I am not saying that great science is the most important thing we can do. Some
things, like family and our basic view of the world, are far more important.
But, doing great science is a huge dream of mine and something I really want
to do.

My writing will focus heavily on strategy and, to a lesser extent, passion. I
will be actively avoiding reviews of tool XX or scheduling technique YY, not
because those things aren’t useful, but because most of us shouldn’t be
worrying about them, yet. Instead, we should be developing the right mental
habits and nurturing the deep love for our field required to do great science.
So, I will be writing largely about doing those things. That doesn’t mean I
won’t mention tools or techniques, only that I won’t be discussing them apart
from the strategies that make them useful.

Way of the Scholar is a collection of experiments. Not everything I write
about will end up working. I fully expect for much of what I try to fail, and
not necessarily even for the right reasons. But, that excites me. Science uses
experiments built on testable hypotheses. Whatever the outcome of these
experiments, we learn something by systematically affirming or negating one
hypothesis at a time. We’ll do the same thing here, but instead of studying
chemistry or astrophysics, we’ll be studying the process of doing great
science. Over time, the hope is that we gain a deeper and more complete
understanding of what that takes, and we ourselves become better scientists
because of it.

Also, Way of the Scholar is a journey. Doing great science isn’t a destination
that we’ll reach. I’m not shooting for a Nobel Prize or a MacArthur
Fellowship. That’s not what Way of the Scholar is about. It’s about trying to
find the best path from scientific neophyte to regularly and significantly
making the world a better place through great research. Anything else that
comes out of this blog is a nice extra, not the main goal.

#### So, why should I read?

First, Way of the Scholar fills a distinct hole. I’ve been unable to find a
large, cohesive body of work on the process of doing great science[^1].
There’s a lot of undergraduate advice out there and a few graduate comics.
And, there’s plenty being written about living a remarkable life in general,
or through a blog or small business/startup. But, there seems to be a real
dearth of material actively devoted to the process of becoming someone who
does great science. I hope Way of the Scholar will grow to make up for that
lack.

Second, I’m in this for the long haul. I’ve been thinking about the decision
to become a scientist for several years, and I’ve been thinking about starting
Way of the Scholar for most of this year. There’s already a lot of personal
momentum behind this blog, and I don’t think I’ll be able to stop for quite a
while. So, I’ll be posting new ideas every Monday and Thursday evening. Also,
I am not writing for quick money or fame. I honestly want to do great science,
which doesn’t happen overnight. Like I said above, this project is a journey.
Way of the Scholar will share everything I learn along the way.

Third, you should stick around because this is going to be fun. I am pumped to
finally be working toward doing great science, and I am really excited to be
sharing what I learn with you. We’re learning about the process of discovering
things no one has discovered before and which may potentially change the way
large parts of the world live their lives. How cool is that? I hope the
excitement and joy I have for this work comes across in what you’re reading.

Ultimately, I think you should stick around because Way of the Scholar is
helpful to you as you try to do something great, hopefully great science. If
it is not helpful, I want you to let me know. Then, I hope you unsubscribe or
stop reading. I don’t want to waste your time, and I don’t want to delude
myself into thinking my writing is worthwhile if it’s not helping anyone. If
we are honest with each other that way, we have a much better chance of
producing something useful through Way of the Scholar. So, if it’s not helpful
and it’s not fun, let me know and move on. Life’s too short to do anything
else.

#### What’s Next?

Way of the Scholar is just getting started. I’ve taken the proverbial first
step, but there’s still a thousand miles to cover on the way to great science.
I have so much to learn, and the potential benefit is huge. I’m excited about
the journey ahead of us, and I hope you are, too. Thursday, I’ll be taking
another step by kicking off my first major experiment toward doing great
science.

and that this post is the capstone to that series. So that this post makes
sense, you might want to read the ones that came before it:_
