Today, I want to share with you a strategy I learned from Professor Randy
Pausch: one good thief is worth ten good scholars[^1]. It’s an incredibly
important mental habit for doing great science. In fact, without mastering it,
great science is nearly impossible.

#### The Big Idea

**As scientists, we should learn to think like thieves.** 
We shouldn’t _act_ like thieves, but we should learn some of their better habits.
For example, we should learn that it makes no sense to make what you can take.
The world is uninterested in how smart or industrious we are. It’s interested
in results that can be used to create a better world. The more effective we
are for every unit of effort, the better. In that sense, laziness is a virtue.
If we put our effort into reinventing the wheel, no one will care. The wheel’s
a great invention, but someone else beat us to it - a few millennia ago.

Instead, we must build on the results of others to help the world solve its
current and future problems. We’ve got to take the wheel and build a cart.
Problems that have already been well-solved don’t need to be solved again[^2].
 It’s the problems that haven’t been solved that desperately need our
attention. Even if we use the work of others to build our own ideas, our
solutions are no less valuable. Science is cumulative.

Sometimes, all that’s needed to open a new line of work is to look at the
problem from a different angle. After the wheel was invented and the cart
built, someone noticed that the wheel would become much lighter if we hollowed
out portions of it. The spoked wheel was born. From that simple observation, a
whole new family of problems developed, and bicycle manufacturers worldwide
are still working to build lighter, stronger wheels. So, while we sometimes
need to simply plug in old results to solve new problems, we also need to poke
old results in new ways to find new problems.

Newton stood on the shoulders of giants; he built on the work of Copernicus,
Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes, among others. Their early work in describing
the motion of falling objects or the movement of planetary bodies set the
stage for Newton to ask about the underlying structure of these phenomena.
And, instead of simply tidying up loose ends for Galileo or Descartes, he
discovered calculus, universal gravitation, the kinematic equations, and a
host of other things. Newton knew that science was an ongoing effort, much
bigger than the work of one man[^3]. We must learn the same. We don’t need
to spend hours writing code that’s already in a standard library or re-framing
a concept that is already well-covered elsewhere. We don’t need to multiply
effort. We need to multiply results, and we do it by taking the results of
others, acknowledging their work, and moving forward.

One big danger in doing otherwise is that we might reinvent a square wheel.
[The term][2] refers to a case in which a group tries to invent something and
produces a substandard product (the square wheel) compared to something else
already discovered and in common use (the wheel). It’s the scientific
equivalent of showing off for your friends and falling flat on your face.

As we think about new questions, we should constantly ask ourselves, “Who’s
already solved this problem?” If we come up with someone, we should take their
work, build on it, and keep advancing the field’s helpfulness. If no one’s
solved the problem yet, and the answer presents a real chance of helping
someone, then we can go ahead and pursue the problem. Again,the goal is a
better world, not an ego-gratifying display of independent genius.

We also need to learn that not everything is equally worth taking. Thieves
steal the silver but leave the baby food, and we should be no exception as
scientists. We should know about the good work being done and the promising
research that relates to our own. We should read it carefully, with an eye
toward adapting the methods and results to be useful for our own questions. We
need to develop a knack for knowing what’s relevant when we encounter new
research. And, we need to learn what’s not even worth touching.

Another key lesson is that the best thefts are done openly, even flagrantly.
It’s far more interesting when everyone knows what will be taken, when, and by
whom. We should admit to everyone that we are using someone else’s idea so
that we can build on it to present a new and original result. In fact, we
should be careful to provide a clear path back to what we stole so that other
people can build on it, too. We should cite the work we use to develop our
ideas.

#### Not Exactly Role Models

There are a couple things about thieves we would do well to ignore, though.

First, thieves steal. It’s one thing to take what is freely given, and another
to steal it through force or deception. Outright theft is unethical and falls
far short of the standard to which we should hold ourselves. Academic citation
makes it easy to steal things without being a jerk about it. Use it. To do
otherwise is simply plagiarism, which is really a scummy thing to do to
someone.

Second, thieves often work for their own benefit[^4]. If we take, we must
not do it simply for our own gain. We must take because we are desperate to
provide the world the help it needs as quickly as we can. The world urgently
needs solutions.

So, although the way thieves think may be helpful to us as scientists, the
actual choices they make and the initial motivations for those choices are
not. We must instead recognize the hard work of others and work hard ourselves
toward the goal of creating a better world.

#### As for Way of the Scholar

This strategy is particularly important to me, because I want Way of the
Scholar to stand on the shoulders of giants. Some very useful things have
already been said about doing great work and about doing great science, and I
want to add to the conversation, not regurgitate it. People like [Richard
Hamming][3], [Paul Graham][4], and [Cal Newport][5] seem to think and speak
more clearly than most, and I want to credit them for their helpfulness.

Thursday, I’ll take another look at my current 30-day trial: reading
academically for at least an hour each day. Namely, I’ll be talking about what
actually seems to be helpful at this stage of getting to know my field.


[^1]: If you haven’t read his [book][6] or listened to [his][7] [talks][8], do so soon.
[^2]: That’s not to say that the first solution to a problem renders the problem well-solved. It usually doesn’t. But, problems often come in families such that family members are largely similar, but differ on a few key points. A good solution to one problem, doesn’t mean the entire family is solved. Perhaps a good heuristic to see if a problem is well-solved, then, is to ask how much of its family has been solved. The more that has been solved, the better that particular problem has probably been solved.
[^3]: My own research builds on a particular model of human vision that’s been developing for over 50 years, starting with Hubel and Wiesel in the early 1960s. Without using their work, I’d have decades of research to do before even asking my current questions.
[^4]: Robin Hood and his ilk are a notable exception. I don’t really know what to do with them, because as much as I want to condemn their theft, I also want people to have food to eat. It’s easy to rail against stealing as I sit in luxury typing away at my computer. But, starving and penniless, I might not see it as theft. I don’t know.
