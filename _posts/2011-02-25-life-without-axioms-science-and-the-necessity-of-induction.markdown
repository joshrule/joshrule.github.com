I'm a tinkerer. I like tearing things apart and rebuilding them. I don't like
owning things unless I can easily get the tools I'd need to tweak or rebuild
it at the drop of a hat. One of the first things I do with a new project is to
begin building an explicit model of that thing in my head.

Science is no exception. If I'm going to spend a good portion of my life doing
and promoting great science, I want to understand science at its very core. To
help with that goal, I've been examining science's foundational biases, the
assumptions without which it becomes irrelevant or impossible. So far, I've
written about three of these major biases:

*  [the universe has laws][2]
*  [the laws can be known][2]
*  [the laws are constant][3]

All three of these assumptions describe the laws of the universe in relative
isolation. They do little to explain how the laws can be known by people like
you and me. They do little to motivate and explain the scientific method over
reading tea leaves or casting lots. But, because the scientific method
encapsulates our basic biases and gives us a guide to building others, there
must be other assumptions which better highlight learning the laws.

One key bias of science does exactly that. It assumes a world where the only
effective way we can explain things is by figuring them out ourselves.
**Science is biased toward a world where the laws aren't handed to us as
axioms.** We must discover them ourselves.

#### Discovering Knowledge

We have many methods for adding to and manipulating what we know. Among other
things, we perceive things through our senses, remember things we've already
experienced, and reason about ideas.

Most reasoning comes in one of two flavors: induction and deduction. I've
mentioned both before when defining science and the scientific method. But,
I've only treated them cursorily.

Deductive reasoning takes a set of premises and manipulates them via a set of
predefined rules to generate a conclusion. Standard forms of deduction
guarantee the truth of their conclusions, given true premises. Syllogisms like
_All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Therefore, Socrates is mortal_ are
classic deductive arguments, as are mathematical theorems[^1]. Given the
premises, Socrates must be mortal. So, deduction seems like exactly the sort
of reasoning we'd want as scientists. We take what we know, manipulate it, and
in return, get back some interesting conclusion.

But, there's a catch. Deduction requires a set of axioms or premises which are
guaranteed to be true. There can be no doubt about the truth of the premises
if the conclusion is to be guaranteed true as well. At this point, most of
what we've said about science has been assumption, not guaranteed truth.
Moreover, deduction doesn't actually generate knowledge. It merely reorganizes
what we already know. The premises contain all the knowledge any deductive
argument can produce. Because we've assumed that the laws aren't simply handed
to us, we have to find them. We have to generate new knowledge. Deduction
isn't enough for successful science.

We'll have to turn to induction. Classically, induction was defined as
reasoning from the specific to the general. While convenient, that definition
is too restrictive. Instead, induction is better defined as using specific
observations to construct contingent explanations which allow us to predict
other specific observations[^2]. Let's break that down a bit.

Unlike the axioms of deductive arguments which make absolute statements about
all possible observations of a phenomenon, inductive reasoning starts with
only a small subset. When he introduced heliocentrism, Copernicus hadn't made
every possible observation that might confirm or disprove his theory. Instead,
he made a few observations from a very localized part of earth over a very
short period of time. He used those observations to inductively draw a general
conclusion about the relationship of the sun and planets.

On the face of it, jumping from a few observations to general conclusions and
specific predictions seems absurd. It's only when you assume that the universe
has laws which can somehow be known and that those laws remain constant across
time and space that induction begins to make sense as a way of discovering
truth. Induction relies on the existence of an underlying and unchanging truth
and won't work well without it.

A contingent statement is one whose truth isn't guaranteed or necessary.
Heliocentrism isn't necessary in the sense that 1+1=2 is necessary given the
definitions of 1, +, =, and 2. Scientific theories are less like math and more
like the statement _I'll be alive tomorrow_. That sentence may be true, or it
may not. Heliocentrism may be true, or it may not. No axiom or definition
requires that it is true. Induction is contingent largely because it doesn't
assume a set of known axioms or laws. Instead, it holds that we discover those
laws by examining a body of evidence and counting as true the conclusions
suggested by that evidence.

One of the wonderful differences between induction and deduction is that
induction generates new knowledge. Scientific _theories_ aren't just
mathematical _theorems_ that necessarily follow from some set of original
axioms. Instead, science produces explanations which may or may not be true
but which are genuinely new knowledge. The conclusions of science don't
necessarily follow from the world around us, but the idea is that they do a
better job of explaining it than anything else[^3].

#### What Does It All Mean?

Assuming that science gains new explanations inductively implies a great deal
about both how we work and ultimately, what that work means.

First, we, as scientists, don't have the laws of the universe at our disposal.
We think they can be known, and we're trying to learn them, but it's a slow,
toilsome process. The theories we rely on daily, even the theories we call
'laws', are not laws. They are our best approximations to the actual laws,
given the data we've worked with. But, many are almost certainly incomplete or
incorrect.

As we collect more data, we iteratively expand and correct our explanations of
the universe. Eventually, those corrections will shrink to nearly nothing, and
our explanations will become stable. At that point, we'll likely conclude that
those explanations, subject to some margin of error, are the laws of the
universe. Even then, though, science won't have given us a stone tablet
engraved with the actual laws of the universe. We'll probably have a very good
approximation of the laws, but in an inductive world, that's as close as we'll
get.

Second, induction makes our work probabilistic. If you've ever wondered why
science is so concerned with statistics and probability, induction is to
blame. Unlike deduction, induction guarantees nothing absolutely. Instead, it
provides us with the conclusions suggested by the evidence. So, we need some
precise way to say, _based on what I've seen, gravity is probably true_.
Probability theory and statistics provide that precision, and understanding
them well is valuable knowledge. In fact, I've been reading a textbook over
the past month or so to fortify my understanding of the more basic concepts in
statistics. I'm not kidding - Statistics and probability are essential to
doing great science.

Third, because all inductive explanations are probabilistic, all of them can
be changed. Nothing in science is deduced from guaranteed axioms. If you run
excellent experiments which don't match the predictions of current theories,
it could be that those current theories, no matter how cherished, are wrong.
On the flip side, nothing is totally assured in science. Gravity may be a
fundamental law, or it may be the temporary, chance expression of some deeper
law much like a solar flare is the temporary expression of the much bigger
sun. The very theories you rely on today may fade into the ether tomorrow. In
science, nothing beyond the scientific method is sacred. It can all be
rewritten.

Fourth, induction grounds science in experience. [I've argued before][4] that
a surprisingly large amount of science happens in your head or in your
notebook, and that's true. A majority of the explanatory process does happen
before any experiments get run. But eventually, your explanations must stand
up to reality. Without axioms, the evidence of the universe itself is the best
proof we have[^4].

That puts our deductive work in second-place. If you can provide a deductive
proof assuming prior results as premises, that's great. But, it still must
stand up to tests against reality. Experience remains the final test for
everything we do as scientists, because we have assumed that the world doesn't
provide us with its laws. Instead, we have assumed that we must go and find
them ourselves.

Assuming the laws of the universe aren't immediately made known to us requires
that we find another way at them. Induction provides that way, and we can now
move forward with a method for observing, generalizing, and predicting, even
in the face of the unknown.

[^1]: Note that _Socrates is a man_ is both a specific observation and an axiom. The two aren't mutually exclusive.
[^2]: Don't confuse inductive reasoning with mathematical induction. Although they share similar features, mathematical induction generates deductive proofs.
[^3]: We may be able to define engineering as working deductively with scientific knowledge, where science is the inductive work that continues to generate new knowledge. Engineering is interesting and important, but doesn't generate fundamentally new knowledge. Seen this way, much of science is probably better categorized as engineering.
[^4]: Even deductive proofs often benefit from experimental tests, because our explanations are often brittle or incomplete. We miss things when reviewing a proof mentally that become obvious when reviewing it experimentally.
