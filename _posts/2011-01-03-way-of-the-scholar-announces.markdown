Happy New Year! I'm excited by the time we have this year to become better
scientists. And, I have a few things to say about Way of the Scholar as we
kick off the new year:

*  Thanks for letting me take a break last Thursday. I was and still am fighting a pretty bad cold. Some time off was much appreciated.

*  Expect a new post approximately twice a week. One post will typically report on my ongoing 30-day trials, and the other will discuss strategies for becoming better scientists.

*  I'm starting a series next Thursday to explore the fundamentals of doing science and being great at it. Over the last month or so, I've spent more time posting about productivity in general than about science and the particular mental habits required to do great science. But, that's not why Way of the Scholar exists. Productivity is well-covered elsewhere. Way of the Scholar exists to discuss the journey from student to master scientist.

*  The next post on my current trial (day 11) will come Monday.

*  To comment on something I've written, please submit it to [Hacker News][2] and comment on it there. It's full of fantastic people, and the commenting system works incredibly well. Also, feel free to find me on [Twitter][3].

*  To stay updated on the actual content at Way of the Scholar, go ahead and [subscribe][4] via email or rss. That way, you'll get new posts automatically. And, if you like reading at the site, you're more than welcome to do that, too.

*  If you know people who would appreciate what I'm writing, please tell them. I can only tell so many people myself, but we can reach a lot more together.

*  In the future, administrative announcements like these will be made via Twitter. To receive them automatically, please [follow me][3]. If you're not on Twitter yet, go ahead and [sign up][5].

Thanks - I hope your year is breath-taking.
