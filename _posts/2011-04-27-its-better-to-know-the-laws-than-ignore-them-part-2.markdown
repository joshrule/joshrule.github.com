I've [talked][2] about the danger of chaos. Randomness and confusion make
acting in the world and understanding it nearly impossible. Today, I'll look
at how that danger drives science's fourth major assumption.

I've [written][3] elsewhere about the first three of science's major
assumptions, and encourage you to review those before continuing. Then, we'll
look at the fourth major assumption of science: _the laws should be known._

#### There is Order

I showed last time that a chaotic world is a terrible place. Fortunately,
we've assumed our world is not chaotic. The first assumption science makes is
that the universe is governed by laws. There is order.

The existence of laws may be just an assumption, but it's one we have good
reason to make. The sun rises and sets each day. Our hearts beat regularly. We
can act in the world and have lasting impact. Our work isn't immediately
erased by the random convulsions of a chaotic universe. There is order.

Even things which appear random at first glance often have an order to them.
With enough detail and understanding, the action of a roulette ball can be
predicted. The vibrations of molecules that is temperature can be predicted.
Even the interactions of neurons in the brain can be interpreted and
predicted. They're complex problems, to be sure, but with enough information
and insight, they can be solved. Nearly every discovery we make shows us that
reality has definite structure. There is order.

#### What Does it Mean to Claim an Ordered Reality?

Now, claiming that reality is ordered is a very particular claim. It does not
mean that we have every answer or that science has somehow stamped new
structure on reality. We haven't done enough science to that radically re-
order the universe. Even though modern science is several hundred years old,
it's really just beginning.

Instead, my claim that the world is ordered means that whether or not we
understand it, reality exists a certain way. It means that there are things we
can say about reality which are true, and things we can say which are false.
Instead of random and unpredictable, I claim that the universe, for better or
for worse, is structured and predictable. Even if we don't realize or
understand it yet, reality can be explained[^1].

#### What Good is Order?

Science continually revises our understanding of reality's laws, and every
time it does, we are hopefully inching closer to the underlying structure of
reality. We are hopefully closing in on the truth.

Order and structure provide constraints on the world, limits on how reality
can act. By learning those constraints, we can lead better lives. For example,
learning the limits of reality can help us:

more succinctly describe our world.
: \(E= MC^2\) is far more compact than complete descriptions of every mass-energy conversion and nuclear reaction in the universe. The lambda calculus provides a complete description of each one of the infinitely many computable functions (we think), but it can be fully described in a page or two. Understanding the structure behind reality lets you remove redundancy and pack more meaning into the same amount of space. Because our brains can hold only a few ideas in focus at once, that's a powerful result.

care for ourselves.
: By understanding the fundamental structure of reality, we can learn to manipulate and act in reality in ways that fit how the world works. We can do more with less effort. And, with enough understanding, we'll be able to match our actions with the life suggested by our design, bringing optimal fulfillment.

create a better world.
: Science attempts to provide the most likely explanations of reality, and it helps us live the best possible lives by understanding and acting in concert with reality, rather than struggling against it. When we understand how crops grow and what nutrients our bodies need to thrive, we can use that information to feed the world. And a world without hunger is just the beginning.

#### But, Why the Moral Imperative?

These benefits are interesting, but they don't explain why this fourth
assumption is normative. The first three merely described the world: it has
laws, the laws can be known, the laws aren't handed to us. This fourth one,
though, makes a judgment. It claims that it's _better_ to know the laws than
to ignore them. Why?

The answer comes back to the definition of science: an attempt to provide the
most likely explanations of reality. If we reduce the predicted randomness of
a phenomenon by knowing the right laws, we can look more carefully at the
actual causes/explanations behind that phenomenon. That is, better
descriptions of the laws are likely to help us provide better explanations of
reality. Knowing the laws helps us do better science. In fact, the
explanations we provide will ultimately converge to mere combinations of those
more basic laws. So, nailing down the laws is one of science's main goals. If
science does not work to find those laws, it does nothing. Or rather, if
science wants to accomplish its mission, it must seek out the basic laws of
reality, because they provide the best explanations.

Even more, without some impetus to know the truth, some claim that truth is
better than deception and ignorance, we have no reason to do science. We just
have a description of what science is. The assumption that we should know the
laws is the key. To reduce the plagues of randomness, understand the universe
we live in, and find our place in it, we must seek the basic order of the
universe. If we seek to know the truth, and we think randomness is not true,
we must find the laws to prove it.

#### Conclusion

I've described four major assumptions needed to do science:

*  the universe has laws
*  the laws can be known
*  the laws aren't handed to us
*  the laws should be known

We're now in a place where we have roughly outlined the basic structure of
reality (it operates according to knowable laws) and some of our relation to
it (we don't know the laws automatically, but we should learn them). Now, I
can start looking more closely at the actual process of doing science. But
first, I'll use the post next Monday to kick off my next 30-day trial.


[^1]: Recognize that I'm making a bold and uncertain statement. I'm confident that the universe is ordered, but I could be wrong. All this order could be a momentary illusion in an ultimately random reality. I doubt it, and science itself depends on assuming order, but we could all be wrong.
