<p>Humans are remarkably skilled. For instance, we talk, solve mathematical problems, drive cars, build cars, grow food, cook meals, program computers, run experiments, write poetry, and devise arguments to support our beliefs. But, we aren't born with these skills. We <em>learn</em> them, and I want to understand how we learn them. Specifically, I want to know how human cognition, the way we think, changes as we acquire complex skills. I am particularly interested in highly cognitive skills as used in fields such as mathematics, the sciences, computer programming and writing. Perhaps the driving question here is, "How does learning a skill change our thoughts?"</p>

<p>I am interested not only in how we change as we learn individual skills, but also where the sum of those changes eventually lead the most dedicated. Given resources, motivation, and practice, some people develop their skills to such high levels that they can reliably perform far beyond the general population. These people, true experts in their field, seem to experience the world differently than others, in a way uniquely suited to their expertise. I want to understand how their thinking has changed to produce their qualitatively superior performance. Is the way they think also qualitatively different? If so, how? If not, how does the same basic cognition shared between novices and experts support such incredible performance in the expert? The fundamental question here again focuses on cognitive expertise, "How do the world's greatest thinkers actually think?"</p>

<p>Sadly, the answers that exist right now are incomplete. But, the two-pronged approach of combining human behavioral and neuroimaging experiments with computational modeling provides an excellent way to improve our understanding. Technologies like fMRI and EEG give us access to the inner workings of the brain with relatively high resolution, allowing us to see how the various parts of the brain coordinate to perform complex skills. Computational models allow us to easily merge what we learn from individual human experiments into a unified theory. What's more, computational models are rigorously defined and support concrete predictions. Practically, this lets us directly simulate the learning of a new skill, compare the results to actual human data, and use the differences to refine our understanding even further.</p>

<p>Together, these interests provide both my fundamental research questions - How do skills shape thinking? How does expert cognition differ from novice cognition? - and a way to answer them - computational modeling driven by behavioral and neuroimaging experiments.</p>
