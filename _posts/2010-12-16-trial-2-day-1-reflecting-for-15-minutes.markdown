![thinker from steven n fettig on flickr.com][1]

Today, I begin my second [30-day trial][2] for Way of the Scholar. I've
already made it a habit to read academically for about an hour each day. But,
I've still got a long way to go before anyone calls my science great. So, I'm
starting a new trial! For the next thirty days, I'll be adding something to my
todo list each day, and I won't be allowed to sleep until it gets done[^1].

This month, I'll set aside at least 15 minutes at the end of each work day for
reflection. I won't be requiring myself to reflect on any one thing; the only
rule is that my thoughts have to be justifiably related to my science.

Otherwise, I'm keeping this trial as flexible as possible. I concluded the
last 30 days by noting a few things that irked me about the format of the
trial itself. Feeling locked in without the freedom to adapt the experiment
was one of them. So, I've already started brainstorming a few modifications
that I may test drive later in the month. The overall purpose of these trials
isn't to arbitrarily add things to my todo list. I don't need that at all.
Instead, I do these trials to become a better scientist. So, I'm considering:

*  adding a second 15 minute period at the beginning of the day as well
*  boosting the reflection period to thirty minutes
*  introducing a few mandatory questions

(Note: If you missed the first trial, go ahead and catch up in the
[archive][3]. Also, please [subscribe][4] via rss or email so you don't miss
anything from this trial.)

#### Reasons for the Trial

I didn't pick this trial out of a hat. I'm taking cues from the horde of
productive problem solvers who regularly set aside time for some sort of
reflection[^2]. [Richard Hamming][5] set aside his entire Friday afternoon
for years so that he could ask questions about the future of computing. He
made significant contributions to computer science because of ideas he had
during those afternoons. Many of the scientists and engineers I've talked
about before spend similar time on reflection and thinking, including [Paul
Graham][6], [Cal Newport][7], and [Rich Hickey][8]. Even [Immanuel Kant][9]
wouldn't start his day until he'd spent some time simply reflecting and
smoking a pipe. It seems that many people who are serious about solving
problems, spend time reflecting on their work.

I'm also trying to introduce some active control to my workday. Behavioral
economist [Daniel Kahneman][10] claims we have two selves: an experiencing
self and a remembering self. The experiencing self is actually in the middle
of everything, doing the work, and enjoying the challenges of getting things
done. The remembering self evaluates the value of our actions and the
usefulness of our approach. It helps us evaluate what we've done, which helps
us set new directions. The experiencing self is who we are as we do things;
the remembering self is who we are when we ask, "How could I have done that
better?" So, this trial is an attempt to take advantage of the remembering
self. My hope is that by answering questions like, "Why is my work
important?", "How could I have done that better?", or "What does this result
mean?", I'll make better decisions as a scientist and produce better results.

#### Hypotheses

If the basic theory behind this trial is that 15 minutes each day will give me
time to ask and answer guiding questions, what sorts of things should I expect
to see at the end of the month?

*  Last month, I concluded that reading alone is not enough to unearth interesting questions. They must be actively uncovered, and I hypothesize that I can use my periods of reflection to **discover interesting questions** by thinking about the reading I've done or performing a back-of-the-envelope thought experiment. Objective Measure: I'll be looking for two or three small additions to my own work or avenues for future research by the end of the month.

*  Another major outcome I see for this trial is that a period of reflection at the end of the day can help me **understand the exact next step I need to take and why it's important to my research**. I'm hypothesizing that this trial will help me make more consistent progress on my research. Objective Measure: I'll report these next steps in my weekly updates or over Twitter.

*  I'm also excited about the potential to **understand the application of my work**. I've been working on my research for about a month now, but I haven't taken time to understand exactly why this project is important. A period of reflection will let me do that. Objective measure: I'll write about 300-500 words by the end of the month explaining my work and its application.

*  I'm hypothesizing that 15-20 minutes of reflection will also give me a chance to **notice and correct my most dangerous distractions**. I'm continuing to train [RescueTime][11] on my habits. Unfortunately, increased accuracy has unveiled decreased efficiency. My work efficiency over the last week has averaged 4% on ResuceTime. That's abysmal. Objective Measure: I'll count this hypothesis confirmed if my average efficiency climbs to at least 25% for the second half of the trial.

I'm starting right before I leave this afternoon, so expect an update next
Thursday. Also, I'd encourage you to join me on this trial. It doesn't take
nearly as much time as my reading did, but I predict the benefits will be at
least as great. Fifteen minutes a day isn't much to sacrifice for a clearer
understanding of your work and the role it plays in making this world a better
place. If you do join me, be sure to let me know. Thanks, and have a great
day!


[^1]: Over the next 30 days, we've got Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, as well as my anniversary. I will probably take these days off, but I'll let you know in advance.
[^2]: We need to be careful not to do things simply because famous scientists did them. It's foolish to blindly imitate the behavior of others without any consideration for the deeper reasons driving their behavior. Growing my hair out into a wild mane like Einstein would not make me a better scientist. Eschewing non-crucial activities (like scheduling haircuts or purchasing clothes) to spend more thought on questions of science might do the trick, though.
