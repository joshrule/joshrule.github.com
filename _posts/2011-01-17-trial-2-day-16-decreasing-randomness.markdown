It's day 16 of my 30-day trial to devote at least 15 minutes each day to
thinking about my research and larger trends in science and neuroscience. I'd
like to report a few things I've noticed over the past week of the trial, and
make a few plans for the upcoming week.

#### Decreasingly Random

Over the past several weeks, my thinking time has morphed significantly.
Initially, I spent most of my time sitting motionless, occasionally scribbling
something down on a scrap sheet of paper. Slowly, I started jotting more
things down and spent less time sitting motionless. But, my writing was terse
and probably cryptic to anyone reading over my shoulder. Today, I spent nearly
20 minutes writing a complex argument in full-sentences and paragraphs. I
scribbled a few notes here and there, but not nearly as many as in the
previous two weeks.

I don't mention this change just to highlight a shift from short notes to full
paragraphs. Instead, I want to get at the reason for the shift. Since starting
this trial, it's been increasingly valuable to structure my thoughts around
some central theme. Random thoughts here and there are interesting but are
rarely as helpful as forging another link in a more complex chain of ideas.
I'm not trying to become excellent at thinking random thoughts; I'm trying to
become excellent at doing neuroscience. And, I've already come across several
very specific things worth thinking about if I want to do great neuroscience.

It's a strategy I've talked about [before][2], but I want to reinforce this
idea: the path to great science is not a random one. Randomness leads to
average results. Great results demand careful thinking and intense, prolonged
effort.

Accordingly, for the 15-25 minutes I spent on this trial each day, I thought
about just a few specific problems. Isolated thoughts weren't going to get me
very far in finding solutions. I needed more complex ideas with more
sophisticated relationships. I also needed a lot more [thinking outside my
head][3]. I even pulled up a graph or piece of code on screen occasionally to
prompt more careful thinking and make it easier to visualize my ideas. Unlike
the first few days of this trial, I wasn't 'just thinking'. I was considering
well-defined, high-level issues that were highly applicable to my work, such
as _how understanding the composite-face effect has implications going far
beyond the effect itself_.

#### Is It Journaling?

In light of a [recent item][4] on Hacker News noting that high performing
scientists and innovators tend to journal, I also find it interesting that
over the last few weeks, and especially this week, my thinking time has looked
increasingly like journaling. I'm building more complex arguments, writing
outlines, and even drafting full-blown paragraphs. The helpfulness of my
thinking time has also increased. I understand my work more clearly than I
ever have. I'm not sure if the two are correlated, but I'll probably continue
to work out part of a single interesting question each day rather than capture
random thoughts for 20 minutes. I don't know if that means I'm journaling
technically, but it's beginning to make intuitive sense that so many people
doing great work have kept journals.

#### Don't Rush

If you're planning on adding this habit at some point, I've got to encourage
you to give your thinking time plenty of space. I've felt a bit rushed
recently, and it costs me a few minutes at both the start and finish of each
session. I'm either trying to slow down enough to think clearly or starting to
worry about the next thing. So, I'm planning to start my thinking time
slightly earlier in the day. I want more time to think without wondering
whether I'll catch the bus or not. Again, I want to reserve this time for
meaningful high-level questions, not urgent and trivial details.

#### Last Week's Questions

In [my last update][5], I realized that for this trial to be even more
helpful, I needed to think less about productivity and my todo list and more
about science and my research. I needed a better understanding of my recent
simulation results and some inkling of the long-term significance of my
research. So, I proposed three questions whose answers would force me to think
about my work more clearly, and they were the following:

*  What question am I trying to answer with this research? 
*  Why am I trying to answer that question?
*  What information most clearly answers that question? 

Giving myself some specific questions to work through was definitely the right
thing to do. It satisfied the nagging urge I'd been feeling that I could use
this time for more than just [time-tracking][6] and daily review[^1].For
the first time, I began understanding the application of my research and where
it fit in relation to several papers I've been reading. I also began to see
where my work might lead in the future and how I might want to change the
specific simulations I'm running now.

This week, I'll keep thinking about these questions. There's still plenty I
haven't thought through, and I think the answers will drive me to do better
science. But, I'd also like to add two more questions. With a total of five
questions, that leaves me thinking about a different question each day, on
average. The two new questions will be:

*  What initially interested me in neuroscience?
*  Knowing what I do now, what currently interests me most in neuroscience?

I'll post the answers to these questions next week, along with another report
on the trial. Thursday, I want to start talking about bias in science. But, I
want to leave you with the idea that this trial has been incredibly helpful.
In just a few minutes each afternoon, I've already developed a much better
understanding of what my research is about, where I hope to take it next, and
why it's important for the field. If you aren't regularly setting aside time
to answer these sorts of questions, I encourage you to start.

Thanks for reading, and have a great day!
