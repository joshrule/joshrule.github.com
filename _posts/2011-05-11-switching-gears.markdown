It's been 9 days since I've posted anything to _Way of the Scholar_. According
to the [archive][2], I don't normally go that long between posts.

There are a few reasons I haven't posted recently:

*  I've been doing a lot of work for the lab.
*  I'm helping to put on a [big rock concert][3].
*  I've noticed some problems with blogging that continue to bother me.

The first two could be ignored. Life happens. That last one keeps bothering
me.

#### There Is A Problem

Continuing _Way of the Scholar_ as a blog is a bad idea for several reasons.

Quantity Versus Quality
: Some argue that unbreakable publishing schedules help you produce better work.
And in fact, there is [intriguing evidence][4] that producing in higher
quantity can help you produce better quality in some cases. Personally, I want
to continue writing daily, because the more ideas I have, the better my best
ideas are likely to be. Still, not everything I write will be worth
publishing, and I don't want to waste your time by flooding you with mediocre
ideas just because my schedule tells me to publish. I only want to share ideas
I stand behind. Those don't pop up everyday. They take time to develop.

Chronological Structure
: _Way of the Scholar_ is ultimately more of a guidebook than a series of random
events connected accidentally by time. As it develops, it will have a definite
logical structure, ushering people through a series of ideas. A blog doesn't
lend itself to that type of writing. It's best for random ideas that just
happen to occur in succession. I've lost track of my thoughts pretty easily
stuffing the logical framework behind _Way of the Scholar_ into a blog. It
just isn't working.

Portion Size
: Some of the topics I want to write about are big and must be discussed in
small pieces to make sense. When blogging, you can write a series, but those
usually last only a few posts each and are typically linear. They also tend to
be pretty tightly controlled. You know from the beginning how the series will
end. You move from an introduction to idea 1 to idea 2 to idea 3 to the
conclusion. I'd like something to help me dive into complex ideas without
losing total track of where I am in the larger framework. I'd also like a tool
which lets me start with just the seed of an idea that can grow and develop
over time. Instead of a list, I need an outline.

Revision
: I'd like to rework most of what I've written to tie my ideas more closely
together and present a more consistent argument. Blogs aren't designed to do
that. They're designed for the latest and greatest, where you can post once
and move on to the next new thing. They're not designed to be mulled over,
revised, and revisited several times. But, that's the type of writing I want
to do.

#### So What?

So, I'm going to take some time away from posting here. I'll use that time to
write new tools to create a better _Way of the Scholar_. You can track my
progress over on [GitHub][5]. Before I switch over to the new site, I'll post
here one last time with any new information you'll need. If you're not already
[subscribed][6] to get posts over email or rss, now would be a great time to
do that. I'll probably be gone for a couple of months while I write, test, and
transition to the new site. There may be some periodic updates here, but
nothing like the regular posting you've been seeing. I thought perhaps I could
write these new tools and post regularly at the same time, but so far that
plan hasn't worked at all. Thanks for understanding, and I look forward to
coming back with new ideas soon.

Have a great day!
